The study was conducted in two distinct periods. In the initial 24-week Double-Blind Treatment Period, which included a 6-week up-titration phase and an 18-week maintenance phase, participants were randomized to receive either atogepant (60 mg once daily) or the highest tolerated dose of topiramate (ranging from 50 to 100 mg/day). Following this, eligible participants continued into a 52-week Open-Label Treatment Period, during which all received atogepant (60 mg once daily).
