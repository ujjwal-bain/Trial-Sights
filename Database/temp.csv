Ven-Obi fixed duration over 12 cycles (arm A, standard arm):
Treatment in the standard arm will be the approved combination of venetoclax/obinutuzumab (Ven-Obi). According to the established treatment schema, Ven-Obi treatment consists of 12 cycles, each with a duration of 28 days resulting in a treatment duration of approximately 12 months. Obinutuzumab is administered intravenously on days 1 (and 2), 8 and 15 of cycle 1, and day 1 of cycles 2-6. The continuous daily administration of venetoclax starts on day 22 of the first cycle with a weekly dose ramp-up from 20mg to 400mg over five weeks with the necessary safety measures needed for mitigation and early detection of a tumour-lysis syndrome.

2. Ven-Pirto fixed duration over 15 cycles (arm B):
Arm B evaluates the combination of pirtobrutinib and venetoclax (Ven-Pirto) in a fixed duration schema over 15 cycles. The duration of each cycle is 28 days. Treatment starts with pirtobrutinib on day 1 of the first cycle and will be continued daily. The daily administration of venetoclax starts on day 1 of the fourth cycle with a weekly dose ramp-up from 20mg to 400mg over five weeks with the necessary safety measures needed for mitigation and early detection of a tumor-lysis syndrome.

3. Ven-Pirto MRD-guided duration of 15 to 36 cycles (arm C):
Arm C evaluates the combination of pirtobrutinib and venetoclax (Ven-Pirto) with an individualized, MRD-guided treatment duration of 15 to a maximum of 36 cycles. The duration of each cycle is 28 days. Treatment starts with pirtobrutinib on day 1 of the first cycle and will be continued daily. The daily administration of venetoclax starts on day 1 of the fourth cycle with a weekly dose ramp-up from 20mg to 400mg over five weeks with the necessary safety measures needed for mitigation and early detection of a tumor-lysis syndrome.

Two treatment arms have a fixed-duration and one arm evaluates a treatment duration based on measurable residual disease (MRD):

? the standard arm A is the established combination of venetoclax and obinutuzumab (Ven-Obi, 12 cycles with a duration of 28 days, Obi only during cycles 1?6),

? arm B evaluates venetoclax plus pirtobrutinib (Ven-Pirto) for 15 cycles (3 cycles pirtobrutinib alone, then 12 cycles combined with venetoclax), and
? in arm C, Ven-Pirto will be administered for at least 15 and up to 36 cycles (as long as there is a deepening of response) until achievement of undetectable MRD (uMRD). To facilitate the transfer to clinical routine, MRD is measured in peripheral blood, by multi-colour flow cytometry and with a cut-off of 10?4. Two MRD assessments with an interval of 12 weeks both documenting uMRD are needed to allow for a treatment discontinuation and treatment will be continued for an additional 12 weeks after the second uMRD result as a consolidation.

In the initial stage, subjects will be accrued to dosing cohorts of increasing dosages of ABT-199 in combination with ibrutinib.

Experimental: ABT-199 and Ibrutinib Combination
Participants will take ABT-199 (dose 100-400 mg) and Ibrutinib (dose 280-560 mg).
Drug: ABT-199 and Ibrutinib Combination
Both are administered orally once daily.

Subjects start treatment with single agent VEN at 100mg PO daily and increase to the allocated dose per table 1.  After 1 week of VEN, subjects start the allocated dose of IBR. Subjects are monitored closely for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and hospitalized for TLS monitoring when starting IBR. Subjects are treated with the combination for 6 months and are encouraged to continue IBR after that time.

The study enrolls in 2 stages.  In the first stage, subjects are enrolled one at a time to sequential arms.  Up to 2 subjects are allowed on each arm in a zone before enrollment in the zone is paused.  Subsequent zones are enrolled once at least one subject in every arm of the zone does not have a DLT during the DLT window.   The second stage begins when a subject has a DLT or all arms have enrolled at least 1 subject.  In the second stage, subsequent subjects are allocated to an arm based on DLT?s and ORR at 2 months occurring in prior patients on the study, thus the study aims to find the optimal dosing combination of IBR and VEN for both toxicity and response.  Enrollment will continue until 10 subjects are allocated to an arm or 28 total subjects are enrolled.

Eligible patients must have documented relapsed MCL after at least 1 line of chemotherapy. Subjects must not have bulky disease, no evidence of TLS, and must not have been previously treated with IBR. 

After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30-35 days, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 12 weeks for up to 3 years.

ASH 2019:
VEN was given alone for 1 week at a dose of 100mg daily. IBR was added on week 2 at the allocated dose. VEN was further titrated to its allocated dose. After one of 15 subjects experienced TLS with one 100mg dose (Davids MS JCO 2018), the study was amended to titrate VEN from 20mg to 100mg over 2 weeks before adding IBR (see figure). 

Relapsed Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is often treated with Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (BTKi); however, post-BTKi relapse can be challenging. Adding venetoclax (VEN) to ibrutinib(IBR) has shown synergy in pre-clinical MCL models. Prior MCL studies of the combination report promising efficacy but have conducted limited dose finding. We sought to identify the optimal dosing combination, based on efficacy and toxicity, utilizing a continual re-assessment method of 6 combinations of IBR (280mg, 420 mg, and 560mg PO daily) and VEN (max dose of 200mg and 400mg PO daily). Eligible participants were not previously exposed to BTKi's and not high risk for Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS). VEN, initiated first at 100mg, then at 20mg PO daily after a TLS event, was started prior to adding IBR and ramped-up based on the dose level. Combination treatment continued for six 28 day cycles. 35 participants were enrolled and treated. One TLS event occurred with starting dose of 100mg VEN; no TLS was seen with 20mg.",Dose Response; Efficacy; Open Label; Pharmacokinetics; Safety; Single Arm,"Study Type:Interventional  (Clinical Trial)

Lemzoparlimab (TJ011133) is being evaluated in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and with azacitidine with/without venetoclax for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Study doctors place the participants in 1 of 5 groups, called treatment arms. Each group receives a different treatment. 
Participants will receive lemzoparlimab (TJ011133) (IV) once weekly (Q1W), venetoclax oral tablets once daily (QD) for 28 days (AML participants) or 14 days (MDS participants) and Azacitidine by SC or IV route QD for 7 days of each 28-day cycle.

here may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests and checking for side effects.

EHA 2018:
Patients were treated with ibrutinib monotherapy (420 mg daily) for the first two cycles of 28 days,  in cycle 3 venetoclax was ramped up weekly from 20 mg to the final dosage of 400 mg daily from start of cycle 4. All patients are treated for 15 cycles; MRD negative patients (blood and bone marrow, by central flowcytometry, 10^-4 level) are randomized 1:2 between maintenance ibrutinib or observation thereafter, MRD positive patients continue ibrutinib monotherapy. Patients in the observation arm are assessed for blood MRD every three months; venetoclax + ibrutinib is reinitiated upon MRD >10^-2.

EHA 2019:
Patients are treated with ibrutinib monotherapy (420 mg daily) for two (28 days) cycles. In cycle 3 venetoclax is ramped up weekly to the final dosage of 400 mg daily from start of cycle 4. Combination of venetoclax + ibrutinib is given for  a total of 15 cycles; patients achieving undetectable (uMRD) on blood and bone marrow (by central flow cytometry, <10-4 level) are randomized thereafter 1:2 between maintenance ibrutinib or observation (stopping therapy). patients becoming MRD positive (>10-2) during observation reinitiate combination treatment with the same regimen. Patients MRD positive at cycle 15 remain on ibrutinib maintenance therapy until progression

ASH 2021:
Patients (BTK inhibitor naïve) received ibrutinib lead-in (420 mg daily) for two (28-day) cycles. Venetoclax ramp-up was initiated during cycle 3, reaching 400 mg daily at cycle 4 with continued V+I during cycle 4-15. Patients reaching at least partial remission (PR) and undetectable (u)MRD (<10-4) in blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM, by central 8-color flow cytometry) at cycle 15 day 15 were randomized 1:2 between ibrutinib maintenance (arm A) or treatment cessation (arm B). 

Participants with undetectable MRD (<10-4; less than one chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cell per 10 000 leukocytes) in peripheral blood and bone marrow after 15 28-day cycles of oral ibrutinib (420 mg once daily) plus oral venetoclax (weekly ramp-up 20 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, up to 400 mg once daily) were randomly assigned (1:2) to ibrutinib maintenance or treatment cessation. Patients who were MRD positive continued to receive ibrutinib monotherapy. Patients who became MRD (>10-2) during observation reinitiated treatment with ibrutinib plus venetoclax. 

EHA 2023:
Patients received I for 2 (28-day) cycles followed by V+I combination. Patients reaching at least partial remission(PR) and flow-based undetectable (u)MRD (<10-4) in blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM), at cycle 15 (C15 were randomized 1:2 between I maintenance (arm A) or treatment cessation (arm B).

patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either VEN/AZA or SOC. In the investigational arm, patients will receive 3 cycles of VEN (400 mg PO QD, days 1-28, initial ramp-up) and AZA (75 mg/m2 SC QD, days 1-7) for induction, followed by 9 further identical consolidation cycles for patients in CR/CRi/CRh and absence of molecular failure. Patients treated within the SOC arm will receive one cycle of DA+GO for induction therapy (IT1), combining cytarabine (200 mg/m2 CIV, days 1-7), daunorubicin (60 mg/m2 IV QD, days 3-5) and GO (3 mg/m2 IV QD; days 1, 4, 7). Patients not achieving CR after IT1 will receive age-adapted HAM (cytarabine 1000-3000 mg/m2IV BID, days 1-3 plus mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 IV QD, days 3-5) for IT2. Patients achieving CR/CRh will receive a maximum of 3 cycles of age-adapted IDAC (1000-1500 mg/m2 IV BID, days 1-3) for post-remission treatment. Every enrolled patient will be followed up for at least 2 years from enrollment.


In the investigational arm venetoclax will be administered orally with an initial ramp-up (100/200/400 mg) on days 1?3 of the first cycle, reaching 400 mg QD. Azacitidine will be administered subcutaneously 75 mg/m2 QD on days 1?7. If AZA is paused or delayed due to hematologic toxicity, VEN should be paused or delayed accordingly. Each new VEN/AZA cycle begins with the administration of AZA on day 1, provided neutrophils are ??1.0?×?109/L and platelets???75?×?109/L, but not before day 29 of the previous cycle. VEN should be administered continuously from day 1 to day 28 unless dose interruptions are indicated. Dose modifications will be made according to the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and are also indicated in case of co-administration with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Application of G-CSF is restricted to after first remission (at least CRh).

Within the SOC arm patients will receive one cycle of induction therapy consisting of cytarabine (200 mg/m2 CIV, days 1?7), daunorubicin (60 mg/m2 IV QD, days 3?5) and GO (3 mg/m2 IV QD; days 1, 4, 7). Patients not achieving CR after IT1 will be treated with age-adapted HAM, which includes cytarabine (1000?3000 mg/m2 IV BID, days 1?3) and mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2 IV QD, days 3?5). For post-remission therapy, patients will receive a maximum of three cycles of age-adapted IDAC (cytarabine 1000?1500 mg/m2 IV BID, days 1?3).

The control group will be given leuprolide acetate every 28 days x 2 prior to starting the frozen embryo transfer preparation.

Standard IVF and preimplantation genetic screening (prior to study entry):

Subjects will undergo standard ovarian stimulation, monitoring (serum and ultrasound), oocyte aspiration, in vitro fertilization (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), embryo culture to the blastocyst stage of development, trophectoderm biopsy, comprehensive chromosomal screening of embryos (CCS) and embryo vitrification as per protocols of CCRM and as determined by the primary CCRM physician.

Initial study entry visit performed within 4 weeks of initial medication administration after confirmation of presence of euploid embryo(s): Complete blood count, chemistry, renal and liver function panels. Computer generated randomization Obtain serum sample for micro RNA evaluation (results will not impact treatment and will only be analyzed retrospectively) Cycle Day2-4 serum FSH, estradiol, LH, progesterone, hCG level and transvaginal ultrasound examination to evaluate endometrial lining and the presence/absence of ovarian cysts All patients will be instructed to avoid pregnancy through use of barrier contraception while on study drug
Initial dosing Once screening evaluation has been cleared by the investigator, subject will be administered Lupron Depot 3.75 mg intramuscularly on cycle day 2-6 or will self-administer elagolix 200 mg orally twice daily beginning 2-6
Week 4 (30 days after initial dosing) Subjects will have repeat FSH, estradiol, LH, progesterone, and hCG levels drawn Subjects will be interviewed by study coordinator regarding presence or absence adverse outcomes/side effects including incidence and severity of hot flushes, vaginal bleeding, headache, nausea and vomiting Unless subject wishes to discontinue trial or is experiencing significant adverse events necessitating drop-out, patients in Lupron group will receive a second dose of Lupron Depot 3.75 mg intramuscularly and those in the elagolix dose will continue 200 mg twice daily oral dosing for an additional 30 days which will be dispensed at this visit
Week 8 (60 days after initial dosing) Subjects will have repeat FSH, estradiol, LH, progesterone and hCG levels as well as CBC and chem panel including liver function tests drawn.

Embryo transfer Vitrified euploid embryo(s) selected for transfer will be warmed on the day of transfer which will be performed under ultrasound guidance using standard CCRM protocols. No more than 2 euploid embryos may be transferred and all patients will be encouraged to undergo a single transfer. Indication for a two embryo transfer will be documented. Best quality embryo(s) will be transferred preferentially choosing day 5 euploid blastocysts over day 6 or 7 euploid blastocysts. Embryos will be graded using the classification system of Gardner et al. (see reference section)
Luteal support Subjects will receive standard luteal support with both injectable and intravaginal progesterone with doses adjusted per CCRM guidelines.

Pregnancy diagnosis and monitoring Subjects will have an initial serum hCG level obtained 9 days after embryo transfer in their local clinic. Estradiol and progesterone levels will also be measured if hCG is positive. Repeat hCG level will obtained two days after the first level if the first level was positive. First pregnancy ultrasound will be obtained 2-2.5 weeks after initial positive hCG level unless there is a clinical indication for an earlier evaluation. If all is normal with first pregnancy ultrasound examination, a second ultrasound examination to evaluate pregnancy will be performed 2-2.5 weeks thereafter unless clinical circumstances require earlier evaluation. Progesterone and estradiol supplementation will typically be tapered using CCRM guidelines beginning at 10 weeks of pregnancy and be discontinued entirely no later than the end of the 13th week of pregnancy.

Subjects will visit the site monthly (28-day months) through Month 6 of the Treatment Period. After the Month 6 visit and through Month 12, on-site  visits will be conducted at Treatment Months 8, 10, and 12; phone contacts will be made at Treatment Months 7, 9, and 11. Months 13 ? 48 of the Treatment Period will be open-label such that all subjects (including those previously randomized to elagolix 200 mg BID alone or placebo) will receive active treatment with elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD.

The total duration for a subject's participation in this study is approximately 51 to 74 months, consisting of the following 4 study periods:
? Washout Period ? up to 10 months prior to Screening (only applicable if subject is taking exclusionary medication at the time of consent; duration of washout depends on the type of exclusionary medication being taken)
? Screening Period ? approximately 1.5 to 4 months prior to first dose of study drug
? Treatment Period ? up to 48-month treatment duration
? Follow-Up Period ? up to 12 months duration following the last dose of study drug. Subjects are expected to enter Follow-Up after completing Treatment Month 48, or if a subject prematurely discontinues from the Treatment Period at the time of or after Treatment Month 6",Active Comparator; Double Blind/Blinded; Efficacy; Multiple Arm; Open Label; Pharmacodynamics; Pharmacokinetics; Placebo Control; Randomized; Safety,"Study Type: Interventional

Venetoclax 600 mg was administered orally once daily on days 2 ? 28 of Cycle 1 and days 1 - 28 of subsequent cycles. A 5-day dose ramp-up schedule was followed to reach the 600 mg dose. LDAC 20 mg/m2 was administered s.c. daily on days 1-10 in 28-day cycles.

ASH 2017:
In cycle 1, VEN was started at 50 mg/day PO and increased over a 5-day ramp-up to reach the designated cohort dose of 600 or 800 mg/day on day 6, which was continued through day 28.In subsequent cycles, the desingated dose of VEN 600 or 800 mg/day was administered on days 1-28. LDAC 20 mg/m2/day SQ was given on days 1-10 of each cycle. 10 received VEN 800 mg and 61 received VEN 600 mg, the recommended phase 2 dose. Among 61 patients given VEN 600 mg, median time on VEN treatment was 6 months (range, <1 to 21 months). 

ASH 2019:
Patients were treated with venetoclax (600 or 800 mg), and with LDAC (20 mg/m2 daily) subcutaneously administered on days 1?10 of each cycle.

Eighty-two patients were treated at the recommended phase II dose: venetoclax 600 mg per day orally in 28-day cycles, with LDAC (20 mg/m2 per day) administered subcutaneously on days 1 to 10. 

EHA 2020:
Before a dose ramp-up of VEN during cycle 1, all pts were hospitalized and received prophylaxis to mitigate the risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Pts were treated at the RP2D: VEN 600 mg QD orally in 28-day (d) cycles, with subcutaneous LDAC 20 mg/m2 QD on d1?10.",Dose Response; Efficacy; Open Label; Pharmacodynamics; Pharmacokinetics; Safety,"Study Type: Interventional (Clinical Trial)

All genotype 1a (GT1a)- infected patients received ribavirin at 200mg once daily and dosed four hours prior to the start of GT1a patients on hemodialysis.

Patients received 12 weeks of 3D+RBV (GT1a) or 3D (GT1b).

The study consisted of a 12-week treatment period followed by a 24-week post-treatment period. Treatment regimens for patients with HCV GT1a and GT1b infection differed in accordance with the US prescribing information for OBV/PTV/r plus DSV. Patients with GT1a infection received open-label OBV/PTV/r (25/150/100mg once daily) plus DSV (250 mg twice daily) plus RBV (200 mg once daily) for 12 weeks; GT1b-infected patients received this regimen without RBV for 12 weeks. Study drug could be administered at any time without regard to timing of hemodialysis. 

Adverse events (AEs) occurring from the start of study-drug administration until 30 days after the last dose were collected using the MedDRA System Organ Class and preferred term and were assessed by the investigator for relation to study drug and severity. Serious AEs were collected from the time of signed consent until 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Physical examination with vital signs measurement and laboratory assessments were also conducted at each study visit.

Pharmacokinetic samples were collected from patients during each study visit. Patients consenting to intensive pharmacokinetic sampling had samples drawn at the week 4 study visit at hour 0 (prior to study drug administration) and approximately 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours post-DAA dose. Plasma concentrations for OBV, PTV, ritonavir, DSV, DSV principal metabolite (M1), and RBV were summarized as trough levels (Ctrough) based on binning of samples using time of sample collection after dosing, such that concentrations that fall in the interval of 10 to 14 hours and 22 to 26 hours after dosing were considered as Ctrough for BID and QD dosing, respectively.

Patients with GT1a  were assigned to Arm C and received the 3-DAA regimen with RBV 200 mg QD for 12 weeks, while those with fibrosis stage F4 were assigned to Arm D and treated with the same regimen for 24 weeks. Patients with GT1b  were assigned to Arm E and treated with the 3-DAA regimen without RBV for 12 weeks.

Efficacy is assessed by SVR at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12). Safety is assessed in all patients who received at least 1 dose of the study drugs.",Efficacy; Open Label; Pharmacokinetics; Safety; Single Arm,"Study Type: Interventional

Patients will receive omaveloxolone (RTA 408) orally once daily for 1 week prior to initiation of ipilimumab or nivolumab. For patients treated with ipilimumab , the run-in period will be followed by omaveloxolone (RTA 408) orally once daily in combination with ipilimumab administered at Weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. After Week 10, patients will receive maintenance treatment with omaveloxolone (RTA 408) alone once daily. For patients treated with nivolumab, the run-in period will be followed by omaveloxolone (RTA 408) orally once daily in combination with nivolumab administered approximately every two weeks as clinically indicated. Each patient will continue at the assigned omaveloxolone (RTA 408) dose level until disease progression occurs, toxicity requiring discontinuation from study drug (i.e., RTA 408) is experienced, the patient has completed approximately 72 weeks of treatment, the patient is discontinued from the study drug for another reason, or the patient withdraws consent. Patients will return 4 weeks after omaveloxolone (RTA 408) treatment completion for a follow-up visit.

The starting omaveloxolone (RTA 408) dose level for the first dose-escalation cohort in this study has been selected based on available safety and pharmacodynamic data from a Phase 1 study of RTA 408 (NCT02029729). Subsequent cohorts will be enrolled at dose levels based on available safety and PD data from this study, but they will not be greater than 2-fold above the prior dose level.

Phase 1b (dose-escalation): In the phase 1b/2 portion of this study, 12 patients will be enrolled in each dose cohort, with six patients administered omaveloxolone (RTA 408) plus ipilimumab and the remaining six administered rTA 408 plus nivolumab. Subsequent cohorts will assess escalating the doses of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) administered in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab. Dose escalation decisions will be based on ongoing review of all available safety information for enrolled patients.

Phase 2: The Phase 2 portion of the study may include separate expansion cohorts consisting of patients treated with either of the combination therapies. Each expansion cohort will include an additional 24 patients enrolled at the selected Phase 2 dose level to achieve a total of 30 patients at that omaveloxolone (RTA 408) dose in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab.

All subjects will be followed for 48 weeks after randomization of the last subject. Treatment will depend on the results of the genotype. Participants to be followed for an additional 2 years on routine locally-provided HIV care.

The management groups are: (A) genotype shows no evidence of resistance?continue local standard of care second-line regimen with possible NRTI switch; (B) no evidence of resistance to DRV or ETR?randomized to Cohort B1: Best available NRTIs, RAL, and DRV/RTV or Cohort B2: ETR, RAL, and DRV/RTV; (C) resistance to NRTIs and ETR or resistance to ETR alone? best available NRTIs, RAL, and DRV/RTV; (D) multiple NRTI resistance and/or DRV/RTV resistance?best available regimen, includes study-provided and any locally available drugs. All subjects at sites that opt to participate will also be randomized to a cellphone adherence intervention.

Subjects will be assigned to following cohorts: Cohort A, B, C or D.

Experimental: Cohort A: No resistance to NRTIs, PIs, or NNRTI
Subjects will receive second line ART regimens which are usually based on a boosted protease inhibitor (bPI) plus two nucleoside analogues (NRTIs).
LPV/r and ATV/r are the preferred bPIs for second-line ART. TDF + (3TC or FTC) or AZT + 3TC are the most frequent NRTI backbones. Cohort A will not include any of the new drugs; therefore, it is distinct from Cohorts B, C, and D.

Experimental: Sub-cohort B1: Best available NRTIs, RAL, & DRV/RTV
Participants susceptible to DRV/RTV and ETR with or without resistance to NRTIs (and may have resistance to other PIs). Participants without active hepatitis B infection at screening will be randomized 1:1 to sub-cohort B1 or B2.
Subjects will receive Darunavir + Raltegravir.

Experimental: Sub-cohort B2: ETR, RAL, and DRV/RTV
Susceptible to DRV/RTV and ETR with or without resistance to NRTIs (and may have resistance to other PIs). Participants without active hepatitis B infection at screening will be randomized 1:1 to sub-cohort B1 or B2.
Subjects will receive Darunavir + Etravirine + Raltegravir.

Experimental: Sub-cohort B3: RAL, DRV/RTV & FTC/TDF or TDF + 3TC
Participants with active hepatitis B infection at screening will be assigned to sub-cohort B3.
Subjects will receive Darunavir + Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + Raltegravir.

Experimental: Cohort C: NRTI & ETR Resistance or ETR Resistance Alone
May have resistance to PIs other than DRV.
Subjects will receive Darunavir + Raltegravir

Active Comparator: Cohort D: NRTI and/or DRV/RTV resistance or prior RAL exposure
Subjects will receive study provided drugs according to patient resistance profile (DRV, ETR, RTV, FTC/TDF) + any in country available drug as applicable & available.
For Cohort D, in many situations a patient will indeed receive the same regimen that patients are getting in Cohorts B and C if that is the best combination that can be obtained according to his/her resistance profile and drug availability (as for many countries there will be no further drug options beyond the available study drugs).

Other: SOC adherence versus SOC+CPI adherence
- not participating in the adherence randomization.
- randomized to SOC adherence.
- randomized to SOC+CPI adherence.

Drugs:
Darunavir: Participants will be administered darunavir orally as one 600 mg tablet twice a day (1200 mg per day) with food (must be taken with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day [200 mg per day]).
Raltegravir: Participants will be administered Raltegravir orally as one 400 mg tablet twice daily (800 mg per day), with or without food.
Etravirine: Patients will be administered Etravirine orally as two 100 mg tablets or one 200 mg tablet twice a day (400 mg per day) following a meal.
Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: Patients will be administered FTC/TDF orally as one fixed dose combination tablet (FTC 200 mg/TDF 300 mg) once daily, with or without food.

The 4 cohorts in the main study had regimens assigned based on prior ART and real-time genotype: Cohort A (without lopinavir resistance and susceptible to >1 NRTI) stayed on their 2nd line regimen. The other cohorts received regimens with >2 active drugs (see Table). Randomization was stratifed by cohort. Text messages for communication between participants and clinic staff tapered over 48 weeks from 7 to 1x/week.

During the additional long-term FU, HIV-1 RNA was done every 48 weeks and CD4 count at 96 weeks; HIV-1 RNA 200 copies/mL was imputed if necessary if both preceding and succeeding HIV-1 RNA 200; CD4 count changes were estimated.",Active Comparator; Efficacy; Multiple Arm; Open Label; Randomized; Safety,"Study Type: Interventional

ASH 2023:
The fractionated step-up dosing before administering the full dose on C1D8 was included in every cohort preemptively to minimize the potential cytokine release syndrome (CRS) risk. The study will follow a rapid titration single patient dose escalation design until the completion of cohort 3 or until one of the safety conversion criteria are met, whichever comes first, after which the design will be converted to a conventional 3+3 dose escalation.

This study in broken into 2 parts (dose escalation and safety expansion) with 5 arms. During dose escalation (arms 1-3) participants will receive 1 of 3 doses of ABBV-383 to determine the part 2 doses. After completion of the dose escalation portion of the study, the safety expansion (part 2) portion of the study will begin. Two arms (arm 4-5) will begin and participants will receive 1 of 2 doses as determined during the dose escalation portion (part 1). Around 76 adult participants with relapsed/refractory AL amyloidosis will be enrolled at approximately 20 sites across the world.

Participants will receive ABBV-383 as an infusion into the vein for up to approximately 2 year study duration.

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and questionnaires.",Efficacy; Multiple Arm; Open Label; Randomized; Safety,"Study Type  :	Interventional  (Clinical Trial)

The study was conducted in two steps. In Step 1, participants received four weeks of treatment with G/P for acute HCV infection and were then followed 24 weeks post treatment. Participants with HCV recurrence (reinfection, suspected relapse or undefined post-treatment viremia) or HCV virologic failure before or at the Step 1 Week 16 entered Step 2 and were offered HCV re-treatment. The remaining participants were followed in Step 1 for a total of 28 weeks. The study primary and secondary outcome measures pertain to Step 1.

In Step 2, participants were re-treated for up to 16 weeks (G/P or alternate regimen through standard of care), and were followed for 24 weeks post treatment. This post-treatment follow-up included a visit for the determination of HCV sustained virologic response (SVR12) after re-treatment. All summaries of data captured from Step 2 are pooled across HCV re-treatment regimens, as specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

In Step 1, study visits were scheduled at study entry, weeks 1 and 2 (on-treatment), week 4 (treatment discontinuation), and weeks 8, 12, 16 and 28 (post-treatment follow-up). In Step 2, participants had study visits during the re-treatment period, where the number of visits depended on the re-treatment regimen, and at weeks 12 and 24 post treatment. Study visits included physical examinations, clinical assessments, blood and urine collection, questionnaires, and HCV re-infection prevention counseling.",Efficacy; Open Label; Safety; Single Arm,"Study Type: Interventional(Clinical Trial)

Experimental: Venetoclax and Enadisenib
Enasidenib and venetoclax will be taken by mouth (orally), once a day, every day, continuously.

Every 28-day period will be called a cycle. Participants will start venetoclax alone on Cycle 1 Day 1 and continue the study drug alone until Day 15. On Day 15, participants will take enasidenib and venetoclax together and will continue to take the combination of study drugs until intolerable side effects or disease worsening.
Intervention/treatment 
Drug: Enasidenib
Enasidenib is a drug that blocks a protein called isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 2 from working. The family of IDH proteins have been indicated in the development of leukemia. By blocking IDH2, enasidenib may help stop cancer cells from growing. It is believed that the drug may be more useful in patients with a change (mutation) in their IDH 2 protein. The IDH2 gene (substances in the body that contain instructions for the proper development and function of cells) makes IDH2 proteins. As such, only patients with IDH 2 mutated gene are eligible for this study. Enasidenib is currently approved for the treatment of IDH2 mutated AML.

Drug: Venetoclax
Venetoclax is a drug that blocks a protein called B-cell lymphoma (BCL2) protein from working. BCL2 is a protein that helps control whether a cell lives or dies and is thought to help cancer cells to live. Blocking BCL2 is believed to help kill cancer cells. Venetoclax is currently approved for the treatment of type of blood cancer called chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have received prior treatment.

This study will have two parts: Phase Ib and Phase II. The part that patients may participate in will depend on when they join the study.

In the phase Ib portion of the study, small groups participants will receive increasing doses of venetoclax in combination with a flat dose of enadisenib until the highest dose or best dose of venetoclax that is safe and tolerable in combination with enadisenib is found.

In the phase II portion of the study, an additional group of participants will receive the highest or best dose of venetoclax found in the Phase 1b portion of the study with a flat dose of enadisenib to see how useful the combination is in treating relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

ASH 2021: 
Participants received VEN continuously starting on cycle 1 day 1 with a 3-day ramp-up to a target dose of 400 mg daily (dose level 0) in cohorts 1 and 2. ENA was administered at 100 mg daily continuously starting on cycle 1 day 15. Each cycle was 28 days. Concurrent use of a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor was allowed with 50% dose reduction of VEN after completion of the first 2 cycles at 100% target dose.

Intervention:
Drug: Venetoclax
Venetoclax blocks an important pathway that promotes cell survival in tumor cells that overexpress BCL-2, so venetoclax causes cells to die
Drug: Daunorubicin
Chemotherapy is most effective at killing cells that are rapidly dividing.
Drug: Cytarabine
Chemotherapy is most effective at killing cells that are rapidly dividing.

INDUCTION: Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-11, daunorubicin intravenously (IV) on days 2-4, and cytarabine IV on days 2-8.

CONSOLIDATION: Patients receive venetoclax PO QD on days 1-8 and cytarabine IV on days 2, 4, and 6.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

Arms:
Experimental: V-RBAC (RBAC followed by Venetoclax)
Induction phase: RBAC --> up to 6 cycles for low risk (LR) patients and up to 4 cycles for high risk (HR) patients.
Patients proceeding to Venetoclax treatment will receive consolidation with single agent Venetoclax 800 mg/die x 4 28d cycles (with initial ramp-up dose) of each consolidation cycle. Consolidation will be followed by maintenance with single agent Venetoclax 400 mg/die (V maint ) for a total of 2 years (4 months consolidation+20 months maintenance).
Intervention/treatment:
Drug: Venetoclax
Consolidation and maintenance phases with Venetoclax (for a total of 2 years) after an induction phase R-BAC (up to 6 cycles for law risk patients and up to 4 cycles for high risk patients)

All patients who satisfy the inclusion criteria will receive R-BAC as induction therapy (Rituximab 375 mg/m2 d1, Bendamustine 70 mg/m2 d1,2 Cytarabine 500 mg/m2 d1,2,3; q28). All patients will be treated with 4 cycles of R-BAC,recycling every 28 days. Patients will undergo histological and molecular evaluation, and then differentiated according to their risk profile. 

1) Low risk patients (LR): these patients are meant to receive up to 6 cycles of R-BAC. Patients with PD after 4 cycles will stop treatment and be removed from protocol-specified therapy. Patients with SD after 2 cycles will be re-evaluated for response after 4 cycles and they will stop treatment if in PD. Responsive patients (CR, Cru, PR after 2 cycles; SD after 2 cycles that improved their response at the end of cycle 4) will receive a total of 6 cycles. Patients experiencing excess of toxicity during any of the first 4 cycles may be treated with a total of 4 cycles (end of treatment after 4 cycles) regardless of response to treatment. Patients with less than CR after completion of induction treatment (6 or 4 cycles) will proceed to venetoclax consolidation (Vcons) and maintenance phase (Vmaint), and will be considered as HR patients.

High risk patients (HR): these patients are meant to receive 4 R-BAC cycles before consolidation with venetoclax. However, patients with PD during or after the induction phase will stop treatment and be removed from protocol-specified therapy. Patients responsive to the initial 2 R-BAC or with SD, will be treated with 2 more R-BAC cycles (total of 4 cycles), and will proceed to consolidation phase unless they develop PD. Patients with SD at the end of R-BAC will proceed to consolidation phase. Patients experiencing an excess of toxicity satisfying stop treatment criteria during the initial 3 R-BAC cycles will proceed to venetoclax consolidation after 3 cycles. Consolidation with venetoclax (V) will consist of 4 cycles lasting 28 days each (venetoclax 800 mg/die x 4 28d cycles, see ramp-up scale for initial weeks of treatment in order to reduce tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) risk). After consolidation, all patients except those experiencing PD during consolidation will proceed to V maintenance (Vmaint, single agent venetoclax 400 mg/die) for 20 months (total of 24 months including Vcons and Vmaint).

The treatment phase will extend from the first day of the first course of R- BAC up to 6 courses for LR patients. Patients with LR not in CR after end of R-BAC will enter Vcons and Vmaint (24 months). For patients with HR  disease 4 courses of R-BAC will be followed by 24 months of venetoclax treatment (consolidation+maintenance). The follow-up phase will begin after the completion of the treatment phase. Follow-up will continue until disease progression (PD) is  documented, the patient decides to withdraw from the study, death or the study is ended (expected to be 24 months from the date the last enrolled patient will terminate maintenance phase).

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM I:

INDUCTION: Patients receive cytarabine intravenously (IV) continuously on days 1-7 and idarubicin (or daunorubicin) IV on days 1-3 for 1 cycle. Patients may also receive cytarabine IV on days 1-5 and idarubicin (or daunorubicin) IV on days 1-2 for 1 cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or AML with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) related changes (AML-MRC) receive liposomal daunorubicin IV over 90 minutes and cytarabine IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5 for 1 cycle. Patients may also receive liposomal daunorubicin IV over 90 minutes and cytarabine IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3 for 1 cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

CONSOLIDATION: Patients younger than 60 years old receive cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Patients 60 and older receive cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours on days 1-5 IV. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with AML or AML-MRC receive liposomal daunorubicin IV over 90 minutes and cytarabine IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM II: Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and azacitidine IV over 60 minutes on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve response, receive venetoclax PO QD on days 1-28 and azacitidine IV over 60 minutes on days 1-7. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3 months for up to 3 years.

Safety expansion cohort to further evaluate recommended phase two dose (RPTD) of ABT-199 administered with standard therapy bortezomib and dexamethasone in approximately 12 subjects.

EHA 2015:
Patients received venetoclax (50-500 mg PO daily) in cycles 1-11 per designated dose escalation cohorts (continual reassessment method); BTZ (1.3 mg/m^2 SC, days 1, 4, 8, 11) and Dex (20 mg PO, Days 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12) in cycles 1-8 (21 days), BTZ+Dex days 1, 8, 15, 22 in cycles 9-11 (35 days), and venetoclax alone in cycle 12 and beyond

ASH 2015:
A fixed dose of venetoclax ranging from 50 to 800 mg PO daily, according to dose cohort assignment, was given in combination in cycles (C) 1?11 and alone in C12 and beyond.

ASCO 2016:
Patients received daily VEN, per assigned dose escalation (DE) cohorts (50?1200 mg), combined with B (1.3 mg/m^2SC) and D (20 mg PO) for 11 cycles, and VEN alone thereafter.  

After a 2-week lead in period with weekly dose escalation, VEN was given daily at final doses of 300, 600, 900, or 1200mg in dose escalation cohorts and 1200mg in the safety expansion. Pts who progressed during VEN monotherapy could receive VEN plus dexamethasone and continue in the study.

EHA 2017
Median time on VEN monotherapy was 2.5 months (range: 0.2?23); 17 pts received VEN plus dexamethasone after PD for a median of 1.4 months (range: 0.1?13).

Intervention Details:
Drug: OnabotulinumtoxinA 145 UNT [Botox]
Botulinum A toxin injection: Will follow the FDA-approved guideline of the treatment of chronic migraine. The following modifications are planned: (a) Total units 145 instead of 155. (b) Number of injection sites 29 instead of 31. (c) the 6 injection sites in the trapezius muscle will be eliminated as they are irrelevant to our attempt to reduce seizure events. Instead, 4 injections will be made subcutaneously along the superior sagittal suture (see figures below), where no muscles exist and thus no muscle weakness is likely. This dose (145 Units) is well below the FDA-approved guideline on safety for adolescents and adults (no more than 10 Units/Kg or a total of 340 Units).

Botox injections will take place in the BIDMC Headache Clinic which is a part of the Arnold Pain center at 1 Brookline Place. Injections will be administered by Dr. Sait Ashina, the Director of the Headache Clinic.

Arm 1: Experimental: Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel (LCIG)
All participants received LCIG via the N-J tube during the nasojejunal (N-J) Test Period and delivered to the proximal small intestine via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy - with jejunal extension tube (PEG-J) during the Post-PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period. The starting dose was individually determined based on the daily dose of oral levodopa prior to study enrollment.

The infusion dose was individually optimized for each participant on the basis of response and potential adverse events. During the PEG-J Period, LCIG was expected to be infused continuously over approximately 16 hours daily with a rate of infusion ranging from 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour).
Assigned Interventions: Drug: Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel
Dose levels will be individually optimized. Infusion should be kept within a range of 0.5-10 mL/hour (10-200 mg levodopa/hour) and is usually 2-6 mL/hour (40-120 mg levodopa/hour)

The study consists of one or two induction periods and may last up to 40 weeks.
If at week 12 the treatment has not worked (clinical response not achieved) patients who were on risankizumab will be re-randomised for a further 12 weeks (Induction 2) to receive one of three different treatments with risankizumab (at three different doses). Patients who were on the placebo in Induction 1 with no clinical response at week 12 will receive risankizumab (one dose) for another 12 weeks. All patients in Induction 2 will be given a matching placebo to maintain the study blind.
Patients who have achieved a clinical response at week 12 or 24 in the study may be eligible to enter in the maintenance study.
Patients, who did not enter in the maintenance study, will be contacted 105 days from the last treatment received to obtain information on any side effects.

Patients received  two doses of risankizumab, 600 mg and 1200 mg, compared to placebo.

Patients were randomized 2:2:1 to receive IV RZB 600 mg, 1200 mg, or placebo (PBO) at Weeks 0, 4, and 8.

ASH 2021: 
Patients received epcoritamab in a dose-escalation phase followed by an expansion phase at the recommended phase 2 dose in combination with R2 for 12 cycles (28 days/cycle). 

ASH 2021:
received flat-dose epcoritamab in combination with standard R-CHOP for 6 cycles followed by epcoritamab monotherapy. The study includes a dose-escalation cohort (epcoritamab doses: dose level 1 = 24 mg; dose level 2 = 48 mg).


ASCO 2022
Pts received standard R-DHAX/C with subcutaneous epcoritamab (QW, 21-d cycle [C] 1?3). If HDT-ASCT was postponed, pts could continue epcoritamab monotherapy (28-d C: QW, C4; Q2W, C5?9; Q4W, C?10) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Step-up epcoritamab dosing and corticosteroids were required to mitigate CRS in C1.

Patients will receive subcutaneous epcoritamab + R2 for 12 cycles (28 d/cycle). In the dose-escalation part of the trial, epcoritamab was administered at 24 or 48 mg; in the expansion part, the dose was 48 mg. Pts received their assigned epcoritamab dose as follows: every wk, cycles 1?3; every 2 wk, cycles 4?9; and every 4 wk, cycles ?10 up to 2 y. Corticosteroid prophylaxis and step-up epcoritamab dosing were required during cycle 1 to mitigate CRS.
Pts received epcoritamab (weekly, cycle [C] 1?3; every 2 wk, C4?9; every 4 wk, C?10) and GemOx (every 2 wk, C1?4) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (28 d/C).

ASTCT 2023:
Pts with R/R CD20+ DLBCL eligible for HDT-ASCT received epcoritamab+ R-DHAX/C in 21-d cycles (QW, cycles 1?3). Pts continued epcoritamab monotherapy if HDT-ASCT was deferred (21-d cycle: QW, cycle 4; 28-d cycles: Q2W, cycles 5?9, and Q4W, cycles ?10) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Step-up epcoritamab dosing and corticosteroid prophylaxis were required in cycle 1 to mitigate CRS.

ASCO 2023
Patients received epcoritamab SC + R2 for 12 cycles (Cs; 28 d each). Epcoritamab was dosed QW in C1?3, Q2W in C4?9, and Q4W in C?10 (2a) or QW in C1?2 and Q4W in C?3 (2b) for ?2 y.

ll participants in the trial will receive epcoritamab, as monotherapy or in combination. The following regimens will be investigated:

Arm 1: epcoritamab + rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) in participants with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
Arm 2: epcoritamab + rituximab and lenalidomide (R2) in participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL)
Arm 3: epcoritamab + rituximab and bendamustine (BR) in participants with previously untreated FL
Arm 4: epcoritamab + rituximab, cytarabine, dexamethasone, and oxaliplatin/ carboplatin (R-DHAX/C) in participants with R/R DLBCL eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)
Arm 5: epcoritamab + gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GemOx) in participants with R/R DLBCL ineligible for ASCT due to age, performance status (PS), or comorbidity
Arm 6: epcoritamab + R2 in participants with previously untreated FL
Arm 7: epcoritamab maintenance in participants with FL who achieve a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) with SOC treatment
Arm 8: epcoritamab + reduced dose of R-CHOP (R mini-CHOP) in participants with previously untreated DLBCL who are ineligible to receive full-dose anthracycline
Arm 9: epcoritamab + lenalidomide for second-line treatment in participants with FL who progressed within 24 months of initiation of first-line anti-CD20-containing immunochemotherapy
Arm 10: epcoritamab + rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide phosphate (R-ICE) in participants with R/R DLBCL eligible for ASCT
The trial consists of two parts: Part 1 ('Dose Escalation') and Part 2 ('Dose Expansion'). The primary objective of Part 1 is safety, and it includes Arm 1-5 and Arm 10. Part 2 includes all 10 arms (Arm 1-10) and the primary goal of all arms, except Arm 7, is preliminary efficacy. For Arm 7, the primary goal is safety. Patients in Arm 1-5 and Arm 10 can only participate in either Part 1 or Part 2. Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) will be assessed in Part 1 and for a selected number of patients in Arm 8 during a 28-day period ('safety-run phase'). The arms are conducted in parallel.

Patients with R/R CD20+ FL received subcutaneous epcoritamab + R2 for 12 cycles (28 d each). Epcoritamab was dosed QW in cycles 1?3, Q2W in cycles 4?9, and Q4W in cycles ?10 (2a) or QW in cycles 1?2 and Q4W in cycles ?3 (2b) for ?2 y.

Arm1: Active Comparator: Optimized Medical Treatment (OMT)
Participants randomized to OMT continued their current anti Parkinson's disease (anti-PD) medication regimen for the duration of the study. All anti-PD medications and medications to treat dyskinesia must have remained stable for the duration of the study unless adjustments were medically indicated. The Investigator provided the prescription for continued OMT.
Assigned interventions:
Drug: Optimized antiparkinsonian treatment
Dose levels of prescribed antiparkinsonian medications were individually optimized to their maximum therapeutic effect.

Arm 2: Experimental: Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel (LCIG)
The total daily dose of infusion LCIG was composed of three components: (i) the morning dose, (ii) continuous maintenance infusion dose and (iii) extra doses. A temporary nasojejunal (NJ) tube may have been used initially with the infusion pump to determine a participant's response to this method of treatment and to optimize the dose of LCIG before treatment with a permanent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy - with jejunal extension (PEG-J) tube was started. Following optional NJ and/or PEG-J placement and, at the investigator's discretion, the participant may have begun initiation and titration of LCIG infusion on Day 1 once tube placement was confirmed. The dose of LCIG was adjusted to obtain the optimal clinical response. The rate of LCIG infusion is typically within the range of 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour) in most instances and runs over a period of 16 consecutive hours each day.

Patients receive upadacitinib (UPA) 15 mg once daily (QD), UPA 30 mg QD, adalimumab (ADA) 40 mg every other week, or placebo (PBO) for 24 weeks. 


Pts received UPA15, UPA30, ADA 40?mg, or placebo (PBO) for 24 wks, at which point, PBO pts switched to UPA15 or UPA30. 

Adults (?18 years) were randomized 1:1:1:1 to UPA 15?mg once daily, UPA 30 mg once daily, ADA 40?mg every other week, or PBO

Period 1 includes 24 weeks of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active comparator-controlled treatment followed by 32 weeks of active comparator-controlled upadacitinib; at Week 24 participants assigned to placebo will be switched to upadacitinib according to their randomization assignment.

Participants who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 2:2:2:1:1 ratio to one of five treatment groups:

Group 1: Upadacitinib 15 mg QD
Group 2: Upadacitinib 30 mg QD
Group 3: Adalimumab 40 mg every other week (EOW)
Group 4: Placebo followed by upadacitinib 15 mg QD
Group 5: Placebo followed by upadacitinib 30 mg QD
Randomization will be stratified by extent of psoriasis (? 3% body surface area [BSA] or < 3% BSA), current use of at least 1 non-biologic DMARD, presence of dactylitis, and presence of enthesitis, except for participants from China and Japan, where randomization for each country will be stratified by extent of psoriasis (? 3% BSA or < 3% BSA) only.

Participants who complete the Week 56 visit (end of Period 1) will enter the long-term extension portion of the study, Period 2 (total treatment up to approximately 5 years), and continue study treatment as assigned in Period 1 in a blinded manner until the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1 (Week 56), when study drug assignment in both periods will be unblinded and participants will be dispensed study drug in an open-label fashion until the completion of Period 2.

At Week 16, rescue therapy will be offered to participants classified as non-responders (defined as not achieving at least 20% improvement in tender joint count (TJC) and / or swollen joint count (SJC) at both Week 12 and Week 16). Starting at Week 36, participants who fail to demonstrate at least 20% improvement in either or both TJC and SJC compared to Baseline at 2 consecutive visits will be discontinued from study drug treatment. Additionally, in participants continuing on study drug, starting at the Week 36 visit, initiation of or change in background PsA medication(s) is allowed as per local label.

Patients with PsA were randomized to receive UPA 15?mg once daily, UPA 30?mg once daily, ADA 40?mg every other week, or placebo for 24 weeks. At week 24, patients treated with placebo were switched to UPA 15?mg or UPA 30?mg. Following the approval of UPA 15?mg, the study protocol was amended whereby patients treated with UPA 30?mg were switched to UPA 15?mg (earliest switch occurred at week 104 of the study).",Dose Response; Double Blind/Blinded; Efficacy; Multiple Arm; Pharmacodynamics; Pharmacokinetics; Placebo Control; Randomized; Safety,"Study Type: Interventional

Participation in this study will last approximately 20 months and include 16 ? 22 study visits to the research center and approximately 9 visits that will be conducted over the phone. At the end of the Treatment Period, subjects may have the option of participating in a separate extension study for 6 additional months of treatment with study drug.

This study will take place in three Study Periods. They are the Washout Period, Screening Period and Treatment Period. Not all patients will require a Washout Period. Patients not requiring washout will begin the study during the Screening Period.

The study consists of 4 periods:
Washout Period prior to Screening (only applicable if subject is taking hormonal medication at the time of consent; duration of washout depends on the type of hormonal medication).
Screening Period ? approximately 2.5 to 3.5 months prior to first dose of study drug.
Treatment Period ? 6-month treatment duration.
Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period ? 6-month or 12-month period, depending on the Post-Treatment Month 6 DXA, OR instead of entering the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, subjects may enter into an extension study (Study M12-816) if they are willing and qualify, based on safety parameters, to receive an additional 6 months of treatment, followed by 6 ? 12 months of follow-up.

Washout Period:
Following informed consent, subjects, who are taking or were taking exclusionary medications such as hormonal medications or antifibrinolytics prior to screening that require washout, must enter a Washout Period. Subjects must complete the Washout Period and have had at least 1 menses prior to entering the Screening Period. The duration of the required washout period is based on the excluded hormonal medication that the subject is currently taking, or was taking. Procedures such as medical, social and gynecological history, a complete physical examination (including height and weight) with vital signs and urine pregnancy testing, protocol-related adverse event review will be performed and current medications will be documented. Contraceptive counseling will be provided, and contraceptives dispensed, as necessary. A pelvic ultrasound (transabdominal [TAU] and transvaginal [TVU]) may be performed after obtaining informed consent and prior to a subject entering the Washout Period in order to establish the presence of a qualifying fibroid(s) or uterine volume to avoid an unnecessary and lengthy
washout period.

Screening Period:
Following informed consent (if Washout was not required), subjects will enter into a 2.5- to 3.5-month Screening Period to establish eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. A pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) will be performed to confirm the presence and size of qualifying uterine fibroids and  uterine volume and to rule out exclusionary ovarian cysts. In addition to the ultrasound, a saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) will be conducted to rule out exclusionary gynecological disorders such as pedunculated submucosal fibroids and endometrial polyps. An endometrial biopsy will be performed to rule out endometrial pathology. A mammogram in subjects 39 years of age or older (depending on local or country standard of care) will be performed. DXA scans will be performed to evaluate bone mineral density (BMD) for determination of eligibility. During the Screening Period, subjects must demonstrate MBL of > 80 mL for each of two menses as measured by the alkaline hematin method which quantifies the amount of blood loss on sanitary products. Subjects will be dispensed sanitary product collection kits for 2 to 3 menstrual cycles and will be required to collect all sanitary products on days with menstrual bleeding or spotting, and must return the products to the site within approximately 5 days after cessation of menses. Subjects must be instructed to collect and return all used or worn products even if there is no visible blood on the products. Subjects will also complete the Screening-Baseline Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) questionnaire to assess suicidal behavior and ideation.

Treatment Period:
The Treatment Period begins with Day 1, which will occur between Days 1 to 10 of the first day of menses (defined as full menstrual flow) for all subjects who meet eligibility criteria during the Screening
Period. Subjects will be randomized to receive either placebo (n = 100), elagolix 300 mg BID (n = 100) or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (n = 200). All subjects will self-administer study medication or matching placebo twice daily (in the morning and in the evening approximately 12 hours apart) orally throughout the 6-month Treatment Period. Subjects randomized into the study will visit the site during the 6-Month Treatment Period on Day 1, and then monthly (28-day intervals), at Month 1 through Month 6. Additional study visits may occur either for subjects returning their sanitary products for analysis of alkaline hematin at a Product Collection Visit or for a Premature Discontinuation visit. 

Treatment Period (Continued):
DXA scans will be obtained at Month 6 of the Treatment Period. Sites will be encouraged to schedule the Month 6 DXA as early as possible within the ? 15-day Month 6 treatment window, allowing for the evaluation of BMD prior to entering post-treatment follow-up or the extension study, Study M12-816. Subjects with BMD decrease < 5% in spine and total hip and < 8% in femoral neck will be eligible for entry into the extension study. Subject's with > or= 8% decrease in BMD in the spine, total hip or femoral neck at Month 6 of the Treatment Period are ineligible for entry into the extension study and will enter into the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period. Subjects with BMD decrease > or= 5% to < 8% in spine or total hip must have a repeat DXA scan within approximately 15 days. If the BMD decrease at the repeat scan is < 8% at all anatomical locations, a subject is eligible for entry into the extension study. Subjects with > or= 8% BMD decrease at any anatomical location upon repeat scan are ineligible for entry into the extension study and will enter instead into the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period. Subject's with > or= 8% decrease in BMD in the spine, total hip or femoral neck at Month 6 of the Treatment Period are ineligible for entry into the extension study and will enter into the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period.

Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period:
Eligible subjects who complete the 6-month Treatment Period, may, following consent, enter a separate extension study for 6 additional months of treatment with elagolix (for further details, refer to the Study M12-816 protocol synopsis). Subjects who prematurely discontinue from treatment, decline to participate in, or do not qualify for the extension study, will enter the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period within this study for up to 6 ? 12 months depending on the Treatment Period Month 6 BMD results. For subjects entering the 6- to 12-month Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, visits will be conducted either by phone or on-site from Month 1 through Month 6 and Months 7 ? 12, if applicable. During the phone visits, site personnel will discuss adverse events, concomitant medications, if applicable, obtain the results of the subject's self-administered urine pregnancy test and will remind subjects of the importance of consistent use of appropriate and effective dual non-hormonal contraception through the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period. Subjects may begin taking hormonal contraception or Tranexamic Acid (Lysteda, Cyklokapron, Cyclo-f) after completing the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 2 Visit and having at least 1 menses in the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period. During the on-site visits, Post-Treatment Month 3 and Post-Treatment Month 6, procedures such as TAU, TVU, MRI (if applicable), clinical safety labs and pregnancy testing as well as patient-reported outcome questionnaires, will be performed. All subjects will be required to have a DXA scan at the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 6 visit; however a subject may be required to remain in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period for an additional 6 months (12 months total) depending on the Month 6 and Post-Treatment Month 6 BMD results. If BMD decrease at the Post-Treatment Month 6 DXA is < or = 1.5% in spine and < or = 2.5% for total hip, the
subject is considered to have completed the study. Subjects whose Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 6 DXA BMD results indicate a > 1.5% decrease in the spine or > 2.5% decrease in the total hip will continue in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period for an additional 6 months and will continue to receive monthly calls from the study site at Post-Treatment Month 7, Month 8, Month 9, Month 10, and Month 11; they will return to the study site for a final Post-Treatment Period Month 12 visit to undergo procedures including vital signs and DXA. Adverse event and concomitant medication review will be conducted at all visits during the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, including the phone visits. Subjects who prematurely discontinued from the Treatment Period prior to the Month 3 Study Visit, i.e., who received < 3 months of study drug, are not required to have the pelvic ultrasound, MRI (if applicable) or DXA performed in the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period. A DXA will be performed in the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period for subjects who prematurely discontinue from Treatment only if the
reason for discontinuation was due to BMD decrease or an adverse event of fracture.",Double Blind/Blinded; Efficacy; Multiple Arm; Placebo Control; Randomized; Safety,"Study Type: Interventional

Assigned Interventions for Arm A & B: 
Drug: ABT-199
Arm A (Cohorts 1-8) and Arm B (Cohort 1-6): Subjects in dose escalation phase will receive 1 dose of ABT-199, followed by 6 days off drug, followed by continuous once daily dosing with ABT-199. Arm B (Cohorts 7+): Subjects in dose escalation phase will receive continuous once daily dosing with ABT-199. Arm A and Arm B: Subjects in expanded safety cohort will receive continuous once daily dosing with ABT-199.
Two arms will be implemented for dose escalation: Arm A, CLL/SLL subjects and Arm B, NHL subjects. Arm A is designed to enroll approximately 116 subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL and Arm B is designed to enroll approximately 95 subjects with relapsed or refractory NHL. Fifty-six subjects were enrolled in Arm A and approximately 55 subjects will be enrolled in Arm B during the dose escalation portion of the study, with the objective of defining dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the MTD. Once the MTD is declared for the arm, approximately 60 additional CLL/SLL subjects in Arm A and approximately 20 additional DLBCL subjects and 20 additional follicular lymphoma subjects in Arm B will be enrolled in an expanded safety portion of the study at the recommended phase 2 dose (RPTD) and schedule.

Protocol Amendment #2: will add NHL arm (FPI expected Aug 2011) and addition of 24 NHL subjects (12 dose escalation phase followed by 12 expanded safety cohort).

EHA: 
Patients received a single dose of ABT-199 on Week1 Day ?7 (W1D-7), followed by continuous once-daily dosing from W1D1, until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity.

ASH 2012: 
Patients received ABT-199 on Week 1 Day -7 (W1D-7), followed by continuous once-daily dosing from W1D1, until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity. Due to concerns of potential tumor lysis, a strategy of commencing with a 2 to 3 week lead-in period with step-wise increases to the target cohort dose is being evaluated. In the first four cohorts, the starting dose increased from 50 to 200 mg (50, 100, 200, and 200 mg, respectively), with target cohort doses of 200 mg [n=3], 300 mg [n=3], 400 mg [n=4], and 600 mg [n=7].

ASCO 2013: 
A single oral dose was given followed by 6 days off drug, before continuous once daily dosing. After cohort 1, the initial dose was reduced and daily dosing modified to include a 2 or 3 step dose-escalation to the target dose for each cohort.

NHL arm: Patients were given a single oral dose (50-400mg) followed by six days without medication before being dosed with continuous once-daily dosing.

EHA 2013:
Patients received a single dose of ABT-199 on Week1 Day -3 or -7 (W1D-3, W1D- 7), followed by continuous once-daily dosing from W1D1, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After cohort1, the initial dose was reduced and daily dosing modified to include a 2 or 3 step dose-escalation to the target dose for each cohort.

ASH 2013:
Patients received ABT-199 on Week 1 Day -7 (W1D-7), followed by continuous, once-daily dosing from W1D1 until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.  A 2 to 3 week lead-in period with stepwise escalation starting with lower doses to final cohort doses of 200, 300, 400, 600, and 900 mg was implemented.

EHA 2014
ABT-199 was given on Week 1 Day -7 (W1D-7), followed by continuous, once-daily dosing from W1D1 until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.  A 2 to 3 week ramp-up period with stepwise dose increases was implemented. Final cohort doses of 200 - 900 mg have been evaluated.

Per December 06, 2015 PR:
In the initial dose-escalation phase, all patients (n= 56) received active treatment in one of eight dose cohorts (150-1200mg/day). Additional patients (n= 60) were treated in an expansion cohort with a weekly stepwise ramp-up in dosing to 400mg/day. Patients continued daily venetoclax until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The first dose was 200 mg per day, and patients received a single initial dose followed by a washout period of at least 72 hours, which was followed by continuous daily administration. The occurrence of laboratory changes associated with tumor lysis in the first three patients led to the introduction of stepwise intrapatient increases in dose (ramp-up) to the designated group dose for the subsequent dose-escalation and expansion cohorts, respectively. Supportive care, antiinfection prophylaxis, and growth-factor support for substantial neutropenia were provided.

Per NEJM abstract dated 12/06/2015:
For the expansion cohort, such prophylaxis required inpatient admission before and for 24 hours after the initial administration of the 20-mg dose and the first dose ramp-up to 50 mg. Patients underwent intravenous hydration, received allopurinol with or without rasburicase, and had strict monitoring of biochemical measures that was performed at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours after each of the two doses. For subsequent dose increases, patients received oral hydration
in an ambulatory care facility and had biochemical monitoring 8 and 24 hours after study-drug administration. In addition, patients with any lymph node measuring 10 cm in diameter or more or both bulky adenopathy measuring
5 cm or more and a lymphocyte count of 25,000 per cubic millimeter or more were considered to be at high risk for the tumor lysis syndrome and to require hospitalization for each ramp-up in dose.

Pubmed:
Patients with relapsed or refractory NHL received venetoclax once daily until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity at target doses from 200 to 1,200 mg in dose-escalation and safety expansion cohorts. Treatment commenced with a 3-week dose ramp-up period for most patients in dose-escalation cohorts and for all patients in safety expansion.

The study is conducted in 2 parts: Part A and Part B.

In Part A, all participants will receive a single intravenous (injected directly into a vein) infusion of ATM-AVI. This is to study the safety and effects of a single amount.

In Part B, all participants will receive multiple intravenous infusions of ATM-AVI as treatment for a possible or confirmed infection with gram-negative bacteria.

Number of Arms: 2

Experimental: Part A, Cohorts 1-4
Single dose pharmacokinetics.
Drug: Part A: ATM-AVI Single Dose, Cohorts 1-4
Single intravenous infusion of aztreonam-avibactam over 3 hours to assess pharmacokinetics, safety, and toleration.

Experimental: Part B, Cohorts 1-4
Multi-dose pharmacokinetics and treatment
Drug: Part B: Multiple-dose ATM-AVI, Cohorts 1-4
Multiple intravenous infusions of aztreonam-avibactam over 3 hours, repeated every 6-8 hours up to 14 days to assess pharmacokinetics, safety, toleration, and efficacy.

A total of 48 participants will be enrolled in 4 age cohorts of 12 each, 6 Part A and 6 Part B. Part A will begin enrolling before Part B and no infant may participate in both parts. Cohort 1 will include full term infants age ?13 weeks to <39 weeks and preterm infants postmenstrual age ?50 weeks to <75 weeks. Cohort 2 will include full term infants age ?28 weeks to <13 weeks and preterm infants postmenstrual age ?40 weeks to <50 weeks and ?28 days of age. Cohort 3 will include full term infants age birth to <28 days. Cohort 4 will include preterm infants age birth to <28 days or postmenstrual age <40 weeks.

Participants in Part A must be hospitalized and receiving intravenous antibiotic treatment for a suspected or confirmed bacterial infection. Participants will receive a single 3 hour intravenous infusion of ATM-AVI and have 3 ATM-AVI blood level assessments during and up to 5 hour after the infusion. Participants will be observed for 48 hours following the infusion to assess safety and toleration and will have a final follow-up safety assessment which may be conducted by telephone 4-5 weeks following the infusion. The single infusion of ATM-AVI is administered to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of ATM-AVI and is not intended as treatment for the bacterial infection. The total duration of study participation in Part A is expected to be 5 weeks through the end of the final safety follow-up.

Participants in Part B must be hospitalized with suspected or confirmed aerobic gram-negative bacterial infection requiring intravenous antibacterial therapy. Part B participants will receive multiple 3 hour intravenous infusions of ATM-AVI every 6 hour (8 hours for preterm infants) for 3-14 days as treatment for their bacterial infection and to assess ATM-AVI pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and efficacy. Participants with complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) will also receive intravenous metronidazole and all participants will have the option to receive other intravenous antibiotic treatment for gram-positive bacteria, as appropriate. Participants who have a good clinical response after 72 hours of intravenous ATM-AVI treatment may be switched to a different orally administered antibiotic, if clinically appropriate. Part B participants will have a total of 5 ATM-AVI blood level assessments over the first 2 or more days following the start of ATM-AVI infusions and will have their clinical response assessed at the End of Treatment (intravenous and oral, if applicable), and at a Test-of-Cure (TOC) evaluation 7 to 14 days after the last antibiotic treatment (intravenous or oral). A final safety assessment which may be conducted by telephone will occur 4-5 weeks after the last dose of ATM-AVI. The total duration of study participation in Part B is expected to be up to 7 weeks through the end of the final safety follow-up.

Enrollment for the study will begin with Part A, single dose, cohorts 1-3. Part A Cohort 4 (preterm neonates) will commence enrollment after sponsor and DMC review of plasma drug levels and safety for a least 2 participants in Part A Cohort 3 and review of ATM-AVI safety and tolerability for all participants enrolled at that time. Enrollment in the multidose Part B cohorts will be delayed until preliminary information is obtained regarding ATM-AVI multidose safety, tolerability, and drug levels for the participants 9 months to 2 years of age in the separate ongoing ATM-AVI pediatric study C3601008 [NCT05639647].",Efficacy; Multiple Arm; Open Label; Pharmacokinetics; Safety,"Study Type: Interventional  (Clinical Trial)

Venetoclax administered orally once daily (QD) with various doses and dosing regimens with or without chemotherapy at the discretion of the investigator. Allowed chemotherapy regimens as outlined in the study protocol.
Intervention
Drug: venetoclax
Oral tablet for participants; tablet for oral suspension (participants who cannot swallow a tablet)
Chemotherapy:
Dexamethasone and/or vincristine and/or pegasparaginase OR cytarabine and/or etoposide and/or pegasparaginase; tyrosine kinase inhibitor;  cytarabine OR azacitidine OR decitabine; rituximab and/or dexamethasone and/or vincristine; cyclophosphamide and/or topotecan

ASCO 2020
Pediatric patients (pts) with recurrent or refractory (R/R) solid tumors treated with VEN monotherapy or VEN with cyclophosphamide and topotecan (Cy-Topo).
Seven pts received 800-mg monotherapy for 8 wk; 3 of these pts did not receive Cy-Topo after monotherapy. Of the 7 pts who received VEN-Cy-Topo, 3 pts received 400 mg VEN with Cy-Topo.

Patients received venetoclax monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy.
Patients were treated with venetoclax alone or in combination with hypomethylating agents or cytarabine
A total of 37 patients received treatment with either venetoclax as a monotherapy (n = 3) or in combination with decitabine (n = 5), azacitidine (n = 19), low-dose cytarabine (n = 1) or high-dose cytarabine (HDAC; n = 9). 
Patients received venetoclax monotherapy for 3 weeks before combining it with chemotherapy, unless early disease progression occurred. Following protocol amendment, chemotherapy could begin as early as day 4. To reduce the risk of tumour lysis syndrome, venetoclax was initiated via a 3-day ramp-up to the target AED and patients received prophylaxis.
Treating investigators selected the chemotherapeutic agent. Consistent with labelled doses in adults, the recommended dose of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine (maximum 75 mg/m2 daily) or decitabine (maximum 20 mg/m2 daily) was 400 mg AED orally once daily. Low-dose cytarabine (LDAC; maximum 20 mg/m2 daily) was combined with venetoclax 800 mg AED orally once daily. Following protocol amendment, cytarabine maximum dose was increased to 1000 mg/m2 twice daily (high-dose cytarabine [HDAC]) and combined with venetoclax 800 mg AED.

In Part 1 (dose determination), patients received a weight- or age-adjusted adult equivalent dose (AED) of venetoclax 800 mg orally once daily. If 800 mg AED was not tolerated, a lower dose (400 mg AED) could be used. The recommended dose of 800 mg AED once daily for Part 2 (cohort expansion) was selected upon review of safety data from patients in Part 1, which demonstrated tolerability of the 800 mg AED.",Dose Response; Efficacy; Open Label; Pharmacodynamics; Pharmacokinetics; Safety; Single Arm,"Study Type: Interventional  (Clinical Trial)

Part 2 Expansion: Ilorasertib200 mg administered by mouth twice daily on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle.
Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Intervention/treatment :
Drug: Ilorasertib
200 mg administered by mouth twice daily on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle.

Study Drug Administration:
Each study cycle is 28 days. Patient willtake ABT-348 by mouth 2 times each day on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. The first dose you take on these days is called Dose 1, and the second dose you take each day is called Dose 2.
Patient willtake Dose 1 (the earlier dose) of ABT-348 with 4 ounces (about ½ cup) of water. Patient should fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for 8 hours before taking this dose. Patient need to fast before this dose because eating food may affect the levels of the study drug that is able to enter your system. Patient willbe allowed to have a light snack 2 hours after Dose 1, and then Patient mayeat anything you like 4 hours after the dose.
Patient should take Dose 2 (the later dose) as close as possible to 6 hours after the first dose, but not less than 6 hours after the first dose. You do not need to fast before Dose 2. Patient may eat and drink normally around this dose.
Study Visits:
On Day 1 of each cycle, and on Days 8 and 15 of Cycles 1 and 2:
Patient willhave a physical exam.
Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.
Patient willhave an EKG (Day 1 of Cycle 2 only). For Cycle 3 and after, Patient willhave these EKGs repeated every 3 cycles (Cycles 6, 9, 12, and so on).
On Day 1 of all cycles, urine will be collected for routine tests.
On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond, if you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test.
Every 8 weeks, Patient willhave a chest x-ray, bone scan, MRI/CT or PET/CT to check the status of the disease.
Patient maybe able to have some of these tests/procedures performed at a local lab, clinic, or doctor's office that is closer to your home. The results of these tests will be sent to the study doctor for review. The study doctor or research staff will discuss this option with you in more detail.
Length of Study Drug Administration:
Patient maycontinue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. Patient willno longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.
Patient participation on this study will be over after your last dose of study drug.",Adaptive; Basket; Efficacy; Open Label; Pharmacodynamics; Safety; Single Arm,"Study Type: Interventional  (Clinical Trial)

ASCO 2014: 
ABT-199 treatment starts with a lead-in 20mg daily dosing period with weekly dose increases up to 400 mg daily as the study final dose. Treatment continues once daily until progression or discontinuation for toxicity. Study visits are weekly through week 4 or 5, every 4 weeks until week 36, and every 12 weeks thereafter. 

ASH 2015:
Pts with R/R del(17p) CLL, assessed in peripheral blood (PB) by a central laboratory ( >7% cells by Vysis FISH probe), commenced VEN once daily with a weekly dose ramp-up schedule (20, 50, 100, 200, 400 mg) over a period of 5 weeks with tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) prophylaxis. Pts were treated with daily 400 mg continuous dosing until disease progression or discontinuation for another reason. 
Experimental: Main Cohort
Participants received ABT-199 tablets once daily (QD) orally for up to 79 months. The starting dose was 20 mg daily, increasing over a period of 5 weeks up to the daily dose of 400 mg.
Drug: ABT-199 (Main Cohort)
Participants received a test dose of ABT-199 of = 20 mg on Week 1 Day 1 of the Lead-In Period. For those with significant electrolyte and/or lymphocyte changes within 24 hours of the first dose, the 20 mg dose was maintained for 7 days with escalation to 50 mg on Week 2 Day 1. If none of the electrolyte and/or lymphocyte changes occurred within 24 hours from ABT-199 20 mg dose administration, the participant was dose-escalated to 50 mg on Week 1 Day 2. After the first dose of 50 mg, if no laboratory abnormalities occurred, the participant remained on the 50 mg dose through Week 1. After receiving the 50 mg dose for approximately 1 week (6 to 7 days), the following dose escalation proceeded with weekly increases in dose: ? 100 mg ? 200 mg ? 400 mg (or additional lead-in steps to designated 400 mg dose), as tolerated.

Experimental: Safety Expansion Cohort
Participants received ABT-199 tablets once daily (QD) orally for up to 68 months. The starting dose was 20 mg daily, increasing over a period of 5 weeks up to the daily dose of 400 mg.
Drug: ABT-199 (Safety Expansion Cohort)
Participants received an initial dose of ABT-199 of 20 mg on Week 1 Day 1 of the Lead-In Period. If one or more electrolyte changes (from the 0 hr measurement prior to dosing) suggestive of laboratory tumor lysis syndrome (LTLS) or clinical TLS (CTLS) occurred within 24 hours of the 20 mg dose, no additional doses were administered until resolution. Upon resolution of laboratory abnormalities, the 20 mg dose was continued through Week 1. If no significant findings suggestive of clinical or laboratory TLS occurred within 24 hours, the 20 mg dose was continued through Week 1 Day 7, and escalated to a dose of 50 mg on Week 2 Day 1. Those who had drug interruptions may have been allowed to escalate to and be maintained at 50 mg for 1 week after they had been on a 20 mg dose for at least 1 week (5 - 7 days). After a week at 50 mg, weekly dose escalations were implemented as follows: 100 mg ? 200 mg ? 400 mg (or additional lead-in steps to designated 400 mg dose) as tolerated.

Patients were randomized to risankizumab 150 mg or placebo followed by risankizumab 150 mg at week 24.

Patients were randomized (1:1)  to receive blinded subcutaneous RZB 150 mg or PBO at weeks 0, 4, and 16.

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive subcutaneous risankizumab 150 mg or placebo at weeks 0, 4 and 16 (period 1). At week 24 (period 2), patients who received placebo were switched to risankizumab, and all patients received risankizumab 150 mg every 12 weeks from weeks 28-208.

Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive double-blinded treatment with subcutaneous RZB 150 mg or matched placebo for 24 weeks, administered at weeks 0, 4 and 16

Patients with active PsA were randomized 1:1 to double-blind subcutaneous risankizumab 150 mg or placebo (weeks 0, 4, and 16). At week 24, all patients received open-label risankizumab every 12 weeks until end of study.

In period 1, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either placebo or risankizumab 150 mg at weeks 0, 4, and 16. In period 2, patients who were initially randomized to the placebo group received a blinded dose of risankizumab 150 mg at week 24, and patients who were initially randomized to risankizumab received a blinded dose of placebo. From week 28 onward, patients received open-label risankizumab 150 mg every 12 weeks. Since all patients received risankizumab during the open-label period, patients who were initially randomized to risankizumab are referred to as the ?continuous risankizumab? cohort and those patients randomized to placebo and switched to risankizumab are referred to as the ?placebo/risankizumab? cohort.

ASH:
All patients received 6 cycles of obinutuzumab and venetoclax followed by 6 additional cycles of venetoclax. Obinutuzumab was administered intravenously with 100 mg on day 1, 900 mg on day 2 (option to deliver 1000 mg on day 1), 1000 mg on day 8 and day 15 of cycle 1 and 1000 mg on day1 for cycles 2-6. A gradual weekly dose ramp-up of venetoclax with 20 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg up to 400 mg was administered starting at day 22 of cycle 1.

Patients with previously untreated CLL were randomly assigned to receive either a 12-month duration of Venclexta alongside six-month duration of Gazyva (Arm A) or six-month duration of Gazyva plus chlorambucil followed by an additional six-month duration of chlorambucil (Arm B).

ASCO 2019
Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive equal duration treatment with 12 cycles (C) of standard hlorambucil-obinutuzumab (ClbG) or venetoclax (Ven) 400 mg daily in combination with obinutuzumab (G) for first 6 C.

Initially, there will be a 12-patient safety run-in phase,(including at least 1 patient at high risk of developing TLS) wherein patients will receive obinutuzumab + venetoclax in a non-randomized fashion. After the 12th patient has reached the end of Cycle formal review wil be undertaken by the Sponsor and an iDMC. After the completion of this run-in phase, including full review by the Sponsor and the iDMC, full randomization into the trial will begin. Randomization will be performed by an IxRS. Patients will be assigned in 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment arms through a block stratified randomization procedure.

ASCO 2018:
Patients receive daily oral VEN, weight-adjusted to match the adult-equivalent exposure of 400 mg. Daily oral NAV administration starts on day 3. Based on the patients? weight, up to 3 dose levels (25, 50, and 100 mg) will be explored. Chemotherapy consists of peg-asparaginase (1,250 IU/m^2 intravenous [IV] on days 9 and 22), vincristine (1.5 mg/m2 IV on days 9, 15, 22, and 29), and dexamethasone (20 mg/m^2/day orally on days 9?13 and 22?26). At the investigator?s discretion, chemotherapy may be delayed, not administered, or repeated for a second cycle. Dose escalation is guided by a Bayesian optimal interval design. For each weight group ( < 45 kg and > or = 45 kg), the initial cohort at each dose level enrolls > or = 3 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)-evaluable patients, and additional cohorts > or = 2. DLTs are assessed during the first 42 days. In the absence of progressive disease, patients may receive VEN + NAV for up to 9 months; thereafter, therapy may be continued for those with ongoing benefit.

Patients receive the weight-adjusted equivalent of 200 mg daily Ven exposure on day 1, and 400 mg daily equivalent thereafter. Daily oral Nav administration is initiated on day 3 and given in three dose levels: 25, 50, or 100 mg weight-based equivalent for weight > or =45 kg. Patients may also receive chemotherapy: peg-asparaginase (1,250 IU/m^2 intravenous [IV] on days 9 and 22), vincristine (1.5 mg/m^2 IV on days 9, 15, 22 and 29), and dexamethasone (20 mg/m^2/day orally on days 9?13 and 22?26). Chemotherapy administration can be delayed, repeated for a second cycle, or not administered based on investigator discretion. 

EHA 2019:
Patients received the weight-adjusted equivalent of 200 mg Ven on day 1 and 400 mg equivalent daily thereafter. From day 3 onward, oral daily Nav was administered at 25, 50 or 100 mg for pts weighing =45 kg or at 25 or 50 mg for pts weighing 20 to <45 kg. Pts could receive 2 cycles of chemotherapy with pegylated-asparaginase, vincristine and dexamethasone and additional cycles at the investigators? discretion. Disease assessment by flow cytometry occurred on days 8 and 36 and as clinically indicated. 

ASH 2019:
Pts received the weight-adjusted equivalent of 200 mg Ven on day 1 and 400 mg equivalent daily thereafter. From day 3 onward, oral daily Nav was administered at 25, 50, or 100 mg for pts weighing =45 kg or at 25 or 50 mg for pts weighing 20 to <45 kg according to Bayesian optimal interval design. Pts could receive 2 cycles of chemotherapy with asparaginase, vincristine, and dexamethasone and additional cycles at the investigators? discretion

EHA 2020:
Patients receive 400 mg Ven (weight-adjusted equivalent) QD. Oral Nav was administered daily at 3 dose levels (25, 50, 100 mg) for pts > or =45 kg and 2 dose levels (25, 50 mg) for pts <45 kg. Pts could receive chemotherapy at investigator discretion, consisting of peg-asparaginase, vincristine, and dexamethasone. 

ASH 2020: 
Nav was administered daily at 3 dose levels (25, 50, 100 mg) for patients weighing > or = 45 kg and 2 dose levels (25, 50 mg) for patients weighing <45 kg.  A safety expansion cohort assessed a discontinuous dosing schedule, 21 days on and 7 days off, of Ven with 50 mg Nav (25 mg for patients weighing <45 kg).",Efficacy; Open Label; Pharmacokinetics; Safety; Single Arm,"Study Type: Interventional (Clinical Trial)

Dose Escalation Phase:

Venetoclax plus selinexor will initially be given at dose level 1 in combination with intravenous (IV) cytarabine and fludarabine. Dosing of venetoclax and selinexor will be based on tolerability.

Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy (IT cytarabine, IT methotrexate, and IT methotrexate/hydrocortisone/cytarabine (MHA) are all acceptable) will be given.

G-CSF SC may be given.

Part 1 has been completed and RP2D has been determined to be Dose Level 2. All participants will be treated at Dose Level 2.

Dose Expansion Phase:

Two expansion cohorts will be treated at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Cohort A will include venetoclax-naïve patients, whereas Cohort B will include patients with prior exposure to venetoclax.
Drug: Venetoclax
Given orally (PO)
Drug: Selinexor
Given Orally (PO)
Drug: Cytarabine
Given in to the vein (IV) or intrathecal (IT)
Drug: Fludarabine
Given in to the vein (IV) - Because of the ongoing nationwide shortage of fludarabine, this agent may be omitted during the dose expansion phase of the trial.
Biological: Filgrastim
Given subcutaneous (SubQ, SC)
Biological: Filgrastim
Given subcutaneous (SubQ, SC)
Drug: methotrexate/hydrocortisone/cytarabine
Given intrathecal (IT)
Venetoclax will be given orally (po) once daily on days 1 through 21 and selinexor will be given orally (po) starting on days 1, 8, and 15 OR 1, 3, 8, 10, 15, and 17. Beginning on day 16, patients also receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) daily on days 16-20, cytarabine IV daily on days 16-20, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily on days 16-20. G-CSF may be omitted or extended at the discretion of the treating physician. Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy will be given prior to cycle 1, but may be delayed if clinically indicated. IT cytarabine, IT methotrexate, and IT methotrexate/hydrocortisone/cytarabine (MHA) are all acceptable.
Patients may receive up to 4 cycles of therapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

In the dose level 1 (DL1) cohort, venetoclax was given at 360 mg/m2 per dose (max 600 mg) on days 1-21 in combination with selinexor at 40 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15. For dose level 2 (DL2), venetoclax was dosed as in DL1, and selinexor was dosed at 40 mg/m2 twice weekly on days 1, 3, 8, 10, 15, 17. Chemotherapy (fludarabine 30 mg/m2, cytarabine 2 g/m2 ± granulocyte colony stimulating factor 5 mcg/kg [FLA(G)]) was given on days 16-20. 

At the discretion of the treating physician, ER patients could continue venetoclax until day 28 with additional selinexor (DL1: day 22; DL2: day 22, 24); FLA(G) could either be omitted or given on days 30-34; omission of FLA(G) deemed a patient non-evaluable (NE) for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).",Efficacy; Open Label; Pharmacokinetics; Safety; Single Arm,"Study Type:Interventional  (Clinical Trial)

Nivolumab will be administered by intravenous infusion according to approved dose and dosing schedules.

Patients are divided into 2 groups and 4 subgroups:

Patients in the first group will receive ABBV-428 every 2 weeks. The dose of ABBV-428 will be increased on a regular basis by patient group, to determine the most appropriate dose to be administered during the dose expansion phase to groups of patients according to their disease. In the first, second and third subgroups.

During the dose expansion phase, patients will be divided into 3 subgroups (subgroups A, B, C) according to their disease. They will all receive ABBV-428 every 2 weeks at the best dose determined in the first group.

Patients in the 2nd group will receive ABBV-428 every 2 weeks in combination with nivolumab at the approved dose and frequency. The dose of ABBV-428 will be routinely increased to determine the most appropriate dose for a group of patients with non-small cell lung cancer during the dose expansion phase.

Patients in the 4th subgroup (subgroup D) will receive ABBV-428 every 2 weeks, at the most appropriate dose determined in the 2nd group, together with nivolumab at the approved dose and frequency.

Patients will be followed up to 2 years after the start of treatment of the study.
In the dose-escalation part, ABBV-428 will be injected at escalating doses into patients? bloodstream on days 1 and 15 of 28-day cycles. The dose of ABBV-428 determined as best will then be tested in combination with Opdivo on approved dosing cycle.  In the dose-expansion part, additional patients with different types of solid tumors will be enrolled to further evaluate ABBV-428. A number of additional NSCLC patients will be in the subgroup further evaluating ABBV-428 in combination with Opdivo.

Experimental: Elagolix Dose 1
Subjects will receive Elagolix Dose 1 for 6 month Treatment Period.

Experimental: Elagolix Dose 2
Subjects will receive Elagolix Dose 1 for 6 month Treatment Period.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo
Subjects will receive matching Placebo for 6 month Treatment Period.

The study consists of 4 periods: 1) Washout Period (if applicable); 2) a Screening Period of up to 100 days prior to first dose; 3) a 6 month Treatment Period; and 4) a Post treatment Follow-up Period of up to 12 months (if applicable). An electronic diary will be dispensed and training provided to record endometriosis-associated pain, uterine bleeding, and analgesic medication use for endometriosis-associated pain on a daily basis. Pregnancy testing will be performed monthly throughout the study. Subjects will be required to use nonhormonal dual contraception during the study, and will be counseled on appropriate and effective forms of birth control to promote pregnancy prevention.

Subjects participation in the study may last up to approximately 20 months. Subjects will visit the study center about 14 times and talk to study staff via telephone about 7 times during the study.

The study has four periods: 
- Washout Period, if applicable (up to 12 months before you enter the Screening Period - If subjects take birth control or other hormonal therapies, subjects will have to stop taking these medications so that the medications can leave subjects' body before subjects begin taking the assigned study drug. Subjects will be asked to start using non-hormonal methods of birth control during this period and for the duration of the study (provided at no cost). Subjects will receive counseling on the importance of consistent, appropriate and effective use of birth control.   
- Screening Period (up to 100 days before receiving your first dose of study drug - The study doctor will talk to subjects and run some tests to determine if subjects qualify for the study. Subjects will be given an electronic diary (e-diary) to take home and use to record information about your endometriosis symptoms and medication use. Subjects will need to enter a minimum of 45 daily e-diary entries during this period.
- Study Treatment Period (6 months) - Subjects will visit the study center once a month for a check-up and to receive your assigned study drug. Subjects will take the study drug twice a day (3 tablets in the morning and 2 tablets in the evening). Subjects will continue to make daily diary entries throughout this period. When subjects complete the 6-month Study Treatment Period, subjects will have two options based on whether subjects have experienced side effects of the study drug:
  - Receive active study drug in a separate 6-month extension study or
  - Enter the Follow-up Period of the study and no longer receive study drug
  - Follow-up Period (up to 12 months) - Subjects will visit the study center to have tests to check subjects health or the study staff will call subjects to ask how subjects are feeling.

The study may last up to approximately 20 months. Subjects will have to visit the study center about 14 times and talk to study staff via telephone about 7 times during the study.

Cancer.gov update:
First line regimen:  Patients receive mFOLFOX6 comprised of oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV over 46-48 hours on day 1. Patients receive the assigned biologic agent* based on the results of molecular testing. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Upon first progression (PD1), patients change to second line therapy as tolerated.
Biological Agent: Patients receive one of the following agents based on the results of molecular testing.
HER2+: Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1.
MET+: Patients receive rilotumumab IV over 30-120 minutes on day 1.
EGFR+: Patients receive anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody ABT-806 IV over 15 minutes on day 1.
FGFR2+: To be determined.
VEGFR2+: Patients receive ramucirumab IV on day 1.
Patients will continue the selected therapy after PD1 and PD2 with the other cytotoxic backbones, FOLFIRI and FOLTAX, respectively, unless mutation status changes to one of the other 4 categories at PD1 or PD2 biopsy and molecular assessment. If molecular classification changes at either of these two time points, biologic treatment will change to the new appropriate drug for that molecular category.
Second line regimen: Patients receive FOLFIRI comprised of irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV over 46-48 hours on day 1. Patients receive the assigned biologic agent* based on the results of molecular testing. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Upon second progression (PD2), patients change to third line therapy as tolerated.
Third line regimen: Patients receive FOLTAX comprised of docetaxel IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV over 46-48 hours on day 1. Patients receive the assigned biologic agent* based on the results of molecular testing. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.

ASCO GI 2018:
Baseline tumor BP is performed on PT/ML along with circulating free (cf)DNA. Pts receive first line (1L) mFOLFOX6 + biologic tx based on BP of the ML using a prioritized tx algorithm (HER2+: trastuzumab; MET+: none; FGFR2+: none; EGFR+: ABT806; MSI-H: nivolumab; ?RAS-like?: ramucirumab). MET/FGFR2 arms (~10% of all pts) are tx?d with cytotoxics only and followed for natural outcome until/if tx becomes available on study. At first progression (PD1), pts undergo biopsy of growing ML and change to 2L FOLFIRI + biologic agent as assigned in 1L tx. Upon results of PD1 biopsy, pts change to a new biologic tx if the molecular category evolves. At PD2, pts change to 3L FOLTAX + biologic as determined after PD1, and switch biologic tx from PD2 biopsy result. All PD1/PD2 tumor/cfDNA samples undergo BP to assess evolution and resistance mechanisms.

ASCO GI 2020:
At PD1, pts went to 2L cx + initial AN. Upon results of PD1 BP, pts changed AN only if BP evolved per PTA. The same was done at PD2. If AN was unavailable (MET/FGFR2), these pts were tx?d with cx alone (not ITT).",Active Comparator; Adaptive; Cross Over; Efficacy; Multiple Arm; Open Label; Safety; Umbrella,"Study Type: Interventional

HUMIRA 40MG/0.8ML solution for injection in pre-filled syringe

Patients received background methotrexate and were randomized 2:2:1 to receive upadacitinib (15 mg once-daily), placebo or adalimumab (given as a subcutaneous injection of 40 mg every other week).
Pts were randomized to once-daily (QD) UPA 15mg, PBO, or ADA 40mg every other wk, with all patients continuing background MTX. 

Patients were rescued at Wks 14/18/22 from UPA to ADA, ADA to UPA or PBO to UPA if they met protocol-specified rescue criteria; at Wk26 all remaining patients with CDAI >10 were rescued as above with all remaining PBO pts switched to UPA. Pts continued UPA or ADA in a blinded manner until the last patient completed the Wk48 visit. Completers entered the LTE. 

Pts receiving background methotrexate were randomized 2:2:1 to UPA 15?mg QD, placebo (PBO), or ADA 40?mg EOW. Rescue (PBO to UPA, UPA to ADA, or ADA to UPA) was mandated for lack of response (<20% improvement in tender or swollen joint counts at wks 14, 18, or 22), or failure to achieve Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) low disease activity (LDA) at wk 26. All remaining PBO pts switched to UPA at wk 26. Pts who completed the 48-wk double-blind period could continue to receive open-label UPA or ADA in the LTE for up to 10 yrs total. 

Subject initially prescribed upadacitinib 15 mg once daily or adalimumab 40 mg every other week were switched to the alternate therapy by week 26. 

Per PubMed:
Patients were randomized 2:2:1 to receive upadacitinib 15 mg QD, placebo, or adalimumab 40 mg EOW while remaining on background MTX, and they could also continue oral glucocorticoids (GCs). Patients could be blindly switched within the first 26 weeks from placebo to upadacitinib, upadacitinib to adalimumab, or adalimumab to upadacitinib if one of two switch criteria were met (Fig. 1). Patients who did not achieve???20% improvement from baseline in TJC68 and SJC66 (non-responders) were switched at weeks 14, 18, or 22. Patients who did not achieve CDAI???10 (incomplete responders) were switched at week 26. Patients still on placebo at week 26 were switched to upadacitinib. Switch was immediate (without washout): upadacitinib was administered 2 weeks after the last dose of adalimumab, and adalimumab was administered 1 day after the last dose of upadacitinib. Only one treatment switch was permitted per patient.",Active Comparator; Double Blind/Blinded; Efficacy; Multiple Arm; Non Inferiority; Pharmacodynamics; Pharmacokinetics; Placebo Control; Randomized; Safety,"Study Type: Interventional (Clinical Trial)

Part 1 of the study enrolled HCV GT1 - GT6 infected adolescent participants into the 12 to < 18 years old age group who were willing to swallow the adult formulation of GLE/PIB (Cohort 1). Part 2 of the study enrolled HCV GT1 - GT6 infected pediatric participants divided into the 9 to < 12 (Cohort 2), 6 to < 9 (Cohort 3), and 3 to < 6 (Cohort 4) years old age groups, to receive the pediatric formulation of GLE + PIB. Part 1 enrolled first and once the pediatric formulation was available enrollment into Part 2 commenced, with each cohort enrolled in parallel.

In each cohort, the first group of participants were enrolled into an intense pharmacokinetics (IPK) portion to characterize the PK and safety in each age group, followed by enrollment into a non-IPK safety/efficacy portion. Study participants enrolled in the IPK portion must have been HIV-negative, treatment-naive, and have an identified HCV genotype. In the IPK portion the first approximately six participants received an initial proposed dose of GLE and PIB based on the child's weight and age at screening. PK samples from these participants were evaluated to determine if therapeutic efficacious exposures were attained, comparable to those of adults, and if any dose adjustments were needed. After the intensive PK analysis results for the first six participants were available, enrollment of the remaining IPK portion resumed with subsequent participants receiving an adjusted final dose as applicable. Additional participants may have been required for further intensive PK analysis per age cohort if therapeutic exposure targets were not achieved.

Enrollment into the non-IPK safety and efficacy portions began when the dosing recommendations per age group based on the PK and clinical data from the IPK analysis were ascertained.

Experimental: Azacitidine and Venetoclax
Azacitidine will be given intravenously for 7 days. Venetoclax will be given orally. The patient will start out with 100mg and progress to 600mg. Once 600mg is reached, the patient will stay at this dose until the 28 day cycle is finished.
Intervention/treatment :
Drug: Azacitidine
On day 1 of cycle 1, azacitidine 75 mg/m2 SC or IV will be given, and will continue for 7 days.

Drug: Venetoclax
Starting on day 1 of cycle 1, venetoclax will be initiated. It will be dose escalated to a target dose of 600 mg in the following manner: 100 mg on day 1, 200 mg on day 2, 400 mg on day 3 and 600 mg on day 4. The patient then continues to take the 600mg dose for the remainder of the 28 day cycle. Each dose of venetoclax will be self-administered with approximately 240 mL of water within 30 minutes after the completion of a meal, preferably breakfast. The dose should be administered at the same time each day. On days the subject is given azacitidine, venetoclax must be given first.


This is dose-escalation study of venetoclax followed by a phase II.

INDUCTION: Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) on days 1-7 and venetoclax orally (PO) daily on days 2-28 of course 1 and days 1-28 of subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity and cross over to maintenance.

CONSOLIDATION: Patients receive azacitidine SC or IV on days 1-7 and venetoclax PO on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity and cross over to maintenance.

MAINTENANCE: Patients who achieve complete remission(CR)/ CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi)/ morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS) with minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity receive azacitidine SC or IV on days 1-5 and venetoclax PO on days 1-28. Patients who achieve CR/CRi/MLFS with MRD positivity receive azacitidine SC or IV on days 1-7 and venetoclax PO on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, then annually for 5 years.

ASH 2020:
In cycle 1, pts receive aza 75mg/m2 on days (d)1-7 and ven, escalated from 100 to 200 to 400 to 600mg on d1-4. Ven continues at 600mg d5-28 and bone marrow biopsies (BMBX) occur on d14 and 28. Pts who are MRD-positive may receive up to 3 additional cycles of consolidation: ven 600mg/day d1-28 and aza 75mg/m2 d1-7 of a 28-day cycle. Pts who become MRD negative may proceed to MRD negative maintenance. Pts who are MRD positive after induction and consolidation may proceed to MRD positive maintenance: ven 600mg daily d1-28 with aza 75mg/m2 d1-7 of a 28-day cycle. Conversion to MRD negativity results in a transition to MRD-negative maintenance (Fig 1). While these post-remission options are available, pts are encouraged to discontinue the study and proceed to transplant after achieving a morphologic remission.

ASH 2022
Pts were admitted for ?induction?: dose escalation of ven to 600 mg over a 4 day period (100, 200, 400, 600), continued until day 28, and concomitant aza 75 mg/m2 on d 1-7. Pts without a CR/CRi/MLFS by day 28 either discontinued or repeated an induction cycle, as did those who achieved CR/CRi/MLFS but were MRD+. Up to 3 inductions were permitted for non-responders or MRD+ responders. If pts achieved a response without MRD- after the 3rd induction cycle they moved to MRD+ maintenance: ven 400 mg d 1-28 with aza d 1-7. From the conclusion of the first induction, and continuing with each response assessment, any pt who achieved CR/CRi/MLFS with MRD- went to MRD- maintenance: ven 400 mg d 1-28 and discontinuation of aza

ASH 2024:
Subjects received aza 75mg/m2 IV d1-7 of a 28-day cycle. Ven was escalated to 600mg on days 1-4 and continued x 28 days. Interruptions to allow count recovery between cycles, with growth factor as needed, occured. Subjects had to achieve complete remission (CR), CRi or morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS) by cycle 2 to continue on study. After at least MLFS, subjects could receive up to 3 additional cycles. Once subjects achieved MRD negativity, they could receive MRD-negative maintenance (5 days of aza and 28 days of ven at 400mg). Subjects with MRD after 4 cycles remained on 7 days of aza and 600mg ven. All subjects were encouraged to proceed to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) as soon as they achieved response.",Efficacy; Open Label; Safety; Single Arm,"Study Type :Interventional  (Clinical Trial)

Patients receive ibrutinib PO QD on days 1-28. Beginning on day 1 of cycle  4, patients also receive venetoclax PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 27 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with residual disease or who are positive for MRD after cycle 27 may continue treatment with ibrutinib.

Drug: Ibrutinib

At the start of cycle 4 Venetoclax taken by mouth as weekly dose escalation:
20 mg daily for 1 week, 50 mg daily for 1 week, 100 mg daily for 1 week, 200 mg daily for 1 week, then 400 mg daily for duration of treatment.
Experimental: High-Risk CLL Participants With No Prior Therapy Group
Participants receive Ibrutinib monotherapy for 3 cycles. Each cycle is 4 weeks. At the start of cycle 4, Venetoclax added as a weekly dose escalation. The combination of Venetoclax and Ibrutinib continues for an additional 24 cycles for a total of 27 cycles of treatment.
Drug: Ibrutinib
420 mg by mouth once daily in a 28 day cycle.
Drug: Venetoclax
At the start of cycle 4 Venetoclax taken by mouth as weekly dose escalation:
20 mg daily for 1 week, 50 mg daily for 1 week, 100 mg daily for 1 week, 200 mg daily for 1 week, then 400 mg daily for duration of treatment.

Participant will take 3 capsules of ibrutinib 1 time every day while they are on study with about 1 cup (8 ounces) of water.
If participant misses a dose of ibrutinib, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same day with a return to the normal schedule the following day. Participant should not take extra capsules on the following day to make up the missed dose.
Beginning on Day 1 of Cycle 4, participant will also take tablets of venetoclax 1 time every day for the rest of the study. Each dose of venetoclax will be taken at about the same time as ibrutinib with about 1 cup (8 ounces) of water, within 30 minutes after participant finishes eating a low-fat breakfast.

In order to lower the risk of side effects, participant will start taking venetoclax at a low dose and then it will be increased each week as directed by their doctor until they are taking the full dose.

If participant vomits within 15 minutes of taking venetoclax and all the tablets are still intact, another dose may be taken. Otherwise, participant should not take another dose. In cases where a dose of venetoclax is missed or forgotten, participant should take the dose as soon as possible, as long as it is within 8 hours after the dose was planned to have been taken.
Participant will also be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects beginning 3 days before your first dose of venetoclax. Participant may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.
If the study doctor thinks it is in participants best interest, Cycle 4 may be delayed. In this case, participants will continue taking ibrutinib, but they will not start taking venetoclax until the study doctor thinks that it is safe for participants to do so.

Tumor Lysis Syndrome Monitoring:

Starting about 3 days before receiving your first dose of venetoclax at the beginning of the study and then at any time that the dose increases (and continuing for at least 5 weeks of treatment), you will be given a drug to lower the risk of a serious side effect called Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS). TLS happens when cancer cells break down rapidly. The break-down products enter the bloodstream and are not flushed out quickly enough.

Participant will have blood tests (about 2 tablespoons each time) before their dose and may have blood tests (about 2 tablespoons) 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after their dose. Based on participant's test results, their study doctor may have more instructions for them, and they may need to meet with a kidney doctor while they are in the hospital. Participant will be hospitalized after their first dose of venetoclax to check for or treat TLS. Participant may need to receive fluids by vein.
Study Visits:

Every week during Cycle 1, then every 2 weeks in Cycles 2 and 3, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

On Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1, then on Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3, participant will have a physical exam.

At the end of Cycles 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 27, then every 6-12 months after that:
Participant will have a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy to check the status of the disease.
Participant will have CT or PET scans.

Every week during Cycle 4, then every 2 weeks in Cycles 5 and 6, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

Every week during Cycle 4, then on Day 1 of Cycles 5 and 6, participent will have a physical exam.

On Day 1 of Cycles 7 and beyond:
Participant will have a physical exam.
Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

Physical exams and blood draws may be done more often if the doctor thinks it is needed.

Length of Treatment:

Participant may receive venetoclax for up to 2 years. Participant may continue receiving ibrutinib for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in their best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions.

ASH 2019:
Patients received IBR monotherapy (420 mg daily) for 3 cycles followed by addition of VEN (weekly dose-escalation to a target dose of 400mg daily). Combined therapy was administered for 24 cycles. Pts with bone marrow (BM) undetectable MRD (U-MRD) (assessed by multi-color flow cytometry; sensitivity 10-4) at 24 cycles of combined therapy will stop both VEN and IBR; MRD+ patients could continue IBR.

ASH 2019:
Ibr was continued at 140-420mg/d and standard, weekly dose-escalation of ven was performed, beginning at 20mg/d, until a target dose of 400mg/d was reached. Treatment with the combination of ibr and ven could continue for up to 2 years. 

ASH 2020:
Ibr was continued at 140-420mg/d and standard dose-escalation of ven was performed to the target dose of 400mg/d. Rx with combined ibr and ven continued for a maximum duration of 2y. Pts had bone marrow evaluation for MRD measurement using 4 color flow cytometry (sensitivity 10-4) and CT scan for re-staging every 6mo. Pts in CR with U-MRD on two consecutive evaluations, 6mo apart, stopped ven, but could continue ibr at physician discretion. Pts not in CR with U-MRD at final re-staging after 2 years of combination therapy stopped ven and continued ibr.

ASH 2020:
Pts received IBR 420 mg daily for 3 cycles followed by addition of VEN (weekly dose-escalation to 400mg daily). Combined therapy was given for 24 cycles (28 days/cycle). Pts with bone marrow (BM) undetectable MRD (U-MRD) (flow cytometry; sensitivity 10-4) at 24 cycles of combined therapy discontinued both VEN and IBR; MRD+ pts continued IBR. 

Pubmed 2022;
patients initiated treatment with oral ibrutinib (420 mg once daily) as a single-agent for the first 3 cycles. The goals of ibrutinib monotherapy were to mobilize cells from lymph nodes, reduce tumor burden and consequently decrease the risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), and to have CLL cells with lower level of Mcl-1 protein. After the 3 cycles of ibrutinib, venetoclax was initiated at the start of cycle 4 (Figure 1A). Oral venetoclax was dose-escalated in a weekly fashion (20 mg ? 50 mg ? 100 mg ? 200 mg ? 400 mg) to a target dose of 400 mg once daily, according to the prescribing information for venetoclax in CLL. 

ASH 2023:
Pts received IBR 420 mg daily for 3 cycles followed by addition of VEN (weekly dose-escalation to 400mg daily). Combined therapy was given for 24 cycles (28 days/cycle). Pts with bone marrow (BM) undetectable MRD (U-MRD) (flow cytometry; sensitivity 10-4) at 24 cycles of combined therapy discontinued both VEN and IBR; MRD+ pts continued IBR. A trial amendment allowed an additional 12 cycles of combined VEN and IBR for pts who remained BM MRD+ after Cycle 24.",Efficacy; Open Label; Pharmacodynamics; Safety; Single Arm,"Study Type: Interventional(Clinical Trial)

There will be an open-label extension study for those who qualify, otherwise patients will be treated according to clinical practice.

In the first phase, patients were randomized 4:1 to risankizumab (150 mg), given as a subcutaneous injection at baseline, 4 weeks later and every 12 weeks thereafter, or placebo.

Pts (N=507, stratified by weight and prior TNFi-exposure) were randomized 4:1 to receive either RZB (150 mg at wks 0, 4, and 16) or PBO. At wk 28, pts initially randomized to RZB who achieved a static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) of clear or almost clear (0 or 1) were rerandomized in a double-blind fashion 1:2 to either continue on RZB (150 mg at wks 28 and 40) or be withdrawn from RZB and switched to PBO.

In the first phase, patients were randomized 4:1 to SKYRIZI (n=407)(150 mg), given as a subcutaneous injection at baseline, 4 weeks later and every 12 weeks thereafter, or placebo (n=100). In the second phase of this study (week 28 through week 104), patients originally randomized to SKYRIZI who achieved sPGA 0/1 at week 28 were re-randomized to SKYRIZI (maintenance, n=111) or placebo (withdrawal, n=225). Safety was assessed in all patients. Patients received their last dose of SKYRIZI at week 88 and follow up was conducted until week 104.

Patients initially randomized to receive risankizumab who achieved static Physician?s Global Assessment of clear or almost clear (sPGA 0/1) by week 28 were subsequently re-randomized to placebo.

Experimental: Veliparib + Carboplatin + Paclitaxel
Participants received veliparib 120 mg orally twice daily (BID) on Days -2 to 5 (7 consecutive days) of each 21-day cycle and carboplatin at an area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) 6 mg/mL/min and paclitaxel 200 mg/m² by intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for up to a maximum 6 cycles of treatment, until treatment toxicity which, in the Investigator's opinion, prohibited further therapy, or until radiographic progression.
Intervention/treatment 
Drug: Carboplatin
Carboplatin administered intravenously over approximately 15 to 30 minutes at (AUC 6 mg/mL/min) immediately following paclitaxel infusion.
Drug: Veliparib
Capsules taken orally twice a day, 12 hours apart.
Drug: Paclitaxel
Paclitaxel administered intravenously over 3 hours at a dose of 200 mg/m².
Placebo Comparator: Placebo + Carboplatin + Paclitaxel
Participants received placebo orally BID on Days -2 to 5 (7 consecutive days) of each 21-day cycle and carboplatin at an AUC 6 mg/mL/min and paclitaxel 200 mg/m² by IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for up to a maximum 6 cycles of treatment, until treatment toxicity which, in the Investigator's opinion, prohibited further therapy, or until radiographic progression.
Drug: Carboplatin
Carboplatin administered intravenously over approximately 15 to 30 minutes at (AUC 6 mg/mL/min) immediately following paclitaxel infusion.
Drug: Paclitaxel
Paclitaxel administered intravenously over 3 hours at a dose of 200 mg/m².
Drug: Placebo to veliparib
Capsules taken orally twice a day, 12 hours apart.

Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 120 mg BiD of veliparib or placebo BiD. Dosing of oral veliparib/placebo will begin on C1D-2, 2 days prior to the start of the carboplatin/paclitaxel infusion, and will continue twice a day BiD through C1D5 (7 consecutive days). all subjects will receive carboplatin (auC 6 mg/mL/min) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) iV infusion starting on Day 1 of each cycle. Carboplatin and paclitaxel are to be given only after veliparib/placebo dosing on cycle Day x2 and Day x1 are confirmed. Subjects will continue to receive veliparib/placebo in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel for up to a maximum 6 cycles of treatment, until unacceptable toxicity occurs, or until radiographic progression. Subjects who experience toxicities due to carboplatin/paclitaxel or veliparib may require a delay in the dosing schedule or a dose modification. Should a subject not receive carboplatin and paclitaxel at Day 1, the cycle will be aborted immediately and restarted when the subject is able to do so.

Subject randomization will be stratified by tumor stage (locally advanced versus metastatic), smoking history (current smoker versus never smoked versus past smoker), ECOG performance status (0 versus 1) and region (Western Europe/Australia/Americas versus Eastern Europe/Russia). Screening procedures, quality of life assessment, and baseline radiographic tumor assessments will be 
performed within 21 days prior to starting C1D-2 (i.e., the first day veliparib is administered).

Subjects who complete 6 cycles of treatment will be followed by assessments every 6 weeks until 1 year after beginning treatment (C1D-2), then every 12 weeks. Assessments will continue until radiographic progression, discontinuation from study for additional cancer treatment or death. All subjects who have a Final Visit < 30 days after the last dose of study drug will have a Follow-Up Visit approximately 30 days after the Final Visit.  If a subject is discontinued from the study with an ongoing adverse event or an unresolved clinically significant laboratory result, the site will attempt to provide follow-up until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the laboratory results or adverse event is achieved.",Double Blind/Blinded; Efficacy; Multiple Arm; Pharmacodynamics; Pharmacokinetics; Placebo Control; Randomized; Safety,"Study Type: Interventional

There are 4 parts in this study, with each part consisting of 2 periods, the Treatment Period and the Post-Treatment Period. Part 1 in this study will be enrolled first. After full enrollment in Part 1, available study data will be reviewed to determine whether treatment arms in part 2 may be opened for enrollment. 

There are 7 different treatment arms in part 1 (Arms A, B, C, D, E, F and G), and 9 different treatment arms in part 2 (Arms H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O and P). The arms differ by the combination and doses of study drugs included, as well as the length of treatment.

After completing the treatment period, subjects will return to the study site for an additional 24 weeks after the last dose of study drug in order to see if the HCV can still be detected in your blood.

Patients received once-daily ABT-493 300 mg + ABT-530 120 mg for 8 weeks. SVR4 (HCV RNA below the lower limit of quantitation [25 IU/mL] at post-treatment week 4) and safety are reported.

In part 3, patients without cirrhosis are randomized 1:1 to receive either 12 or 16 weeks of ABT-493/ABT-530 (300 mg/120 mg) once daily.

Treatment-naive or treatment-experienced patients with compensated cirrhosis are treated with ABT-493/ABT-530 (300 mg/120 mg) once daily for 12 or 16 weeks, respectively.

The study consisted of four independent parts with treatment and post-treatment periods of enrollment. Parts 1 and 2 were the supportive/ exploratory parts (phase 2) of the study and part 3 and 4 were the confirmatory/ registrational parts (phase 3) of the study. In parts 1 and 2 of the study, ABT-493 and ABT-530 were co-administered as separate tablets. However, in parts 3 and 4 of the study, the ABT-493/ABT-530 co-formulated tablets were administered.",Adaptive; Dose Response; Efficacy; Multiple Arm; Open Label; Pharmacokinetics; Randomized; Safety,"Study Type: Interventional

Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period ? 6-month or 12-month period, depending on the Post-Treatment Month 6 DXA, OR instead of entering the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, subjects may enter into an extension study (Study M12-816) if they are willing and qualify, based on safety parameters, to receive an additional 6 months of treatment, followed by 6 ? 12 months of follow-up.

Washout Period:
Following informed consent, subjects, who are taking or were taking exclusionary medications such as hormonal medications or antifibrinolytics prior to screening that require washout, must enter a Washout Period. Subjects must complete the Washout Period and have had at least 1 menses prior to entering the Screening Period. The duration of the required washout period is based on the excluded hormonal medication that the subject is currently taking, or was taking. Procedures such as medical, social and gynecological history, a complete physical examination (including height and weight) with vital signs and urine pregnancy testing, protocol-related adverse event review will be performed and current medications will be documented. Contraceptive counseling will be provided, and contraceptives dispensed, as necessary. A pelvic ultrasound (transabdominal [TAU] and transvaginal [TVU]) may be performed after obtaining informed consent and prior to a subject entering the Washout Period in order to establish the presence of a qualifying fibroid(s) or uterine volume to avoid an unnecessary and lengthy
washout period.

Screening Period:
Following informed consent (if Washout was not required), subjects will enter into a 2.5- to 3.5-month Screening Period to establish eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. A pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) will be performed to confirm the presence and size of qualifying uterine fibroids and  uterine volume and to rule out exclusionary ovarian cysts. In addition to the ultrasound, a saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) will be conducted to rule out exclusionary gynecological disorders such as pedunculated submucosal fibroids and endometrial polyps. An endometrial biopsy will be performed to rule out endometrial pathology. A mammogram in subjects 39 years of age or older (depending on local or country standard of care) will be performed. DXA scans will be performed to evaluate bone mineral density (BMD) for determination of eligibility. During the Screening Period, subjects must demonstrate MBL of > 80 mL for each of two menses as measured by the alkaline hematin method which quantifies the amount of blood loss on sanitary products. Subjects will be dispensed sanitary product collection kits for 2 to 3 menstrual cycles and will be required to collect all sanitary products on days with menstrual bleeding or spotting, and must return the products to the site within approximately 5 days after cessation of menses. Subjects must be instructed to collect and return all used or worn products even if there is no visible blood on the products. Subjects will also complete the Screening-Baseline Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) questionnaire to assess suicidal behavior and ideation.

Treatment Period:
The Treatment Period begins with Day 1, which will occur between Days 1 to 10 of the first day of menses (defined as full menstrual flow) for all subjects who meet eligibility criteria during the Screening
Period. Subjects will be randomized to receive either placebo (n = 100), elagolix 300 mg BID (n = 100) or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (n = 200). All subjects will self-administer study medication or matching placebo twice daily (in the morning and in the evening approximately 12 hours apart) orally throughout the 6-month Treatment Period. Subjects randomized into the study will visit the site during the 6-Month Treatment Period on Day 1, and then monthly (28-day intervals), at Month 1 through Month 6. Additional study visits may occur either for subjects returning their sanitary products for analysis of alkaline hematin at a Product Collection Visit or for a Premature Discontinuation visit. 

Treatment Period (Continued):
DXA scans will be obtained at Month 6 of the Treatment Period. Sites will be encouraged to schedule the Month 6 DXA as early as possible within the ? 15-day Month 6 treatment window, allowing for the evaluation of BMD prior to entering post-treatment follow-up or the extension study, Study M12-816. Subjects with BMD decrease < 5% in spine and total hip and < 8% in femoral neck will be eligible for entry into the extension study. Subject's with > or= 8% decrease in BMD in the spine, total hip or femoral neck at Month 6 of the Treatment Period are ineligible for entry into the extension study and will enter into the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period. Subjects with BMD decrease > or= 5% to < 8% in spine or total hip must have a repeat DXA scan within approximately 15 days. If the BMD decrease at the repeat scan is < 8% at all anatomical locations, a subject is eligible for entry into the extension study. Subjects with > or= 8% BMD decrease at any anatomical location upon repeat scan are ineligible for entry into the extension study and will enter instead into the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period. Subject's with > or= 8% decrease in BMD in the spine, total hip or femoral neck at Month 6 of the Treatment Period are ineligible for entry into the extension study and will enter into the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period.

Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period:
Eligible subjects who complete the 6-month Treatment Period, may, following consent, enter a separate extension study for 6 additional months of treatment with elagolix (for further details, refer to the Study M12-816 protocol synopsis). Subjects who prematurely discontinue from treatment, decline to participate in, or do not qualify for the extension study, will enter the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period within this study for up to 6 ? 12 months depending on the Treatment Period Month 6 BMD results. For subjects entering the 6- to 12-month Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, visits will be conducted either by phone or on-site from Month 1 through Month 6 and Months 7 ? 12, if applicable. During the phone visits, site personnel will discuss adverse events, concomitant medications, if applicable, obtain the results of the subject's self-administered urine pregnancy test and will remind subjects of the importance of consistent use of appropriate and effective dual non-hormonal contraception through the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period. Subjects may begin taking hormonal contraception or Tranexamic Acid (Lysteda, Cyklokapron, Cyclo-f) after completing the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 2 Visit and having at least 1 menses in the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period. During the on-site visits, Post-Treatment Month 3 and Post-Treatment Month 6, procedures such as TAU, TVU, MRI (if applicable), clinical safety labs and pregnancy testing as well as patient-reported outcome questionnaires, will be performed. All subjects will be required to have a DXA scan at the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 6 visit; however a subject may be required to remain in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period for an additional 6 months (12 months total) depending on the Month 6 and Post-Treatment Month 6 BMD results. If BMD decrease at the Post-Treatment Month 6 DXA is < or = 1.5% in spine and < or = 2.5% for total hip, the
subject is considered to have completed the study. Subjects whose Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 6 DXA BMD results indicate a > 1.5% decrease in the spine or > 2.5% decrease in the total hip will continue in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period for an additional 6 months and will continue to receive monthly calls from the study site at Post-Treatment Month 7, Month 8, Month 9, Month 10, and Month 11; they will return to the study site for a final Post-Treatment Period Month 12 visit to undergo procedures including vital signs and DXA. Adverse event and concomitant medication review will be conducted at all visits during the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, including the phone visits. Subjects who prematurely discontinued from the Treatment Period prior to the Month 3 Study Visit, i.e., who received < 3 months of study drug, are not required to have the pelvic ultrasound, MRI (if applicable) or DXA performed in the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period. A DXA will be performed in the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period for subjects who prematurely discontinue from Treatment only if the
reason for discontinuation was due to BMD decrease or an adverse event of fracture.

Eligible participants were randomized in a 1:1:2 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment groups: placebo, elagolix 300 mg BID, or elagolix 300 mg twice daily (BID) plus estradiol/norethindrone acetate (E2/NETA) once daily (QD).",Double Blind/Blinded; Efficacy; Multiple Arm; Placebo Control; Randomized; Safety,"Study Type: Interventional

ASH 2020:
Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either navitoclax plus ruxolitinib, or BAT. Navitoclax will be administered orally at a starting dose of 200 mg (platelet count >150 × 109/L) or 100 mg escalated to 200 mg once daily if tolerated after =7 days (platelet count =150 × 109/L); navitoclax may be increased to 300 mg once daily after Week 25 Day 1 at the investigator?s discretion, based on platelet count for patients with suboptimal spleen response; ruxolitinib will be administered orally at the prior stable dose if on ruxolitinib at study entry or at a dose of 10 mg twice daily if no longer on ruxolitinib. 

Per SNCTR:
Experimental Group:
Arm A ? Experimental group: navitoclax + ruxolitinib ? Navitoclax 100/200 mg once daily ? Platelets > 150 × 109/L: 200 mg once daily starting dose ?

After the Week 25 Day 1 visit, dose may be increased to 300 mg once daily at the discretion of the investigator based on platelet count for subjects with sub-optimal spleen response defined as failure to achieve a spleen volume reduction of at least 10%. ? Ruxolitinib twice daily ? Subjects receiving a stable dose of ruxolitinib at Screening will continue at their current stable dose of = 10 mg twice daily ? Subjects with ruxolitinib dose reductions within 4 weeks prior to Screening are considered to be on a stable dose of ruxolitinib if the dose is unchanged for = 2 weeks. The current dose must be = 10 mg twice daily. If the dose reduction was due to thrombocytopenia, platelet counts must be confirmed to be stable by a repeat laboratory test. ? Subjects not receiving ruxolitinib at Screening will receive ruxolitinib at a dose of 10 mg twice daily. ? Ruxolitinib dose adjustment in subjects with hepatic or renal impairment is required and the dose should be determined by the investigator per local label/prescribing guidance.
Duration: Treatment with study drug may continue until end of clinical benefit, occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation criteria have been met. A subject may voluntarily withdraw or be withdrawn from the study treatment at any time for reasons
Control Group: Arm B ? Control group: best available therapy ? The investigator will identify one of the treatment options for each subject prerandomization: ruxolitinib, hydroxyurea, PEG-interferon-a2, or danazol (these 4 options available where AbbVie is providing per country regulations, with the exception of the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Turkey, or other countries where danazol is not permitted);
Subjects in Arm B remain on the selected BAT for the duration of study treatment. Subjects who experience disease progression on the selected BAT will be considered a failure for the study treatment and may pursue alternative post-study therapy

EHA 2020: 
The study is divided in 2 safety run-in cohorts, 2 extension cohorts and a confirmatory cohort. Safety run-in cohort 1 tested safety of venetoclax administered from day 2 at a maximum dose of 400 mg in continuous 28 days courses in combination with fludarabine 30mg/sqm from day 1 to day 5, cytarabine 2000mg/sqm from day 1 to day 5 and idarubicine 8mg/sqm on days 1, 3 and 5 in 6 patients. Dose reduction of venetoclax was mandatory for posaconazole co-administration (maximum dose of 50 mg whenever patient receive posaconazole). Venetoclax administration was suspended on day 21 if patient had no blasts in bone marrow and restarted at hematological recovery. 

ASH 2022: 
Patients divided into 2 consecutive 6-patients safety run-in cohorts (SRI-C1 and SRI-C2), a Part 1 with 2 extension cohorts (P1-C1 and P1-C2), and a confirmatory cohort (Part 2). SRI-C1 tested the safety of VEN administered continuously at a daily dose of 400 mg in combination with FLAI; in SRI-C2 we escalated the dose of VEN up to 600 mg/day. After a positive safety review, patients were randomly allocated in P1-C1 and P1-C2 receiving FLAI in combination with VEN 400 mg or 600 mg, respectively.

 part 2 of the study (confirmatory cohort) where the lower effective dose of VEN (400 mg/day) was administered in association with FLAI

VEN was administered at a daily dose of 400 mg in combination with FLAI (V-FLAI 400) in SRI-C1 and P1-C1, while in SRI-C2 and P1-C2, the VEN dose was escalated to 600 mg/day (V-FLAI 600). In P2 we used the lower effective dosage of V-FLAI 400, with centralized measurable residual disease (MRD) assessment with flow cytometry following ELN guidelines. After V-FLAI induction, consolidation therapy with cytarabine-based regimens and consideration for allogeneic stem cell transplant (HSCT) were conducted. Adjustments to the VEN dose were made for patients concurrently receiving posaconazole. VEN administration was discontinued until recovery for patients achieving remission by day 21 and during consolidation courses.

ASH 2024:
Erythrocyte-lysed whole bone marrow (BM) samples obtained at diagnosis from patients enrolled in the confirmatory cohort were centralized and analysed with a broad panel of monoclonal antibodies to identify the leukemia-associated phenotype (LAIP) which was used to track residual leukemic cells during follow-up. Eight colour flow cytometry analysis was performed at pre-defined TPs (TP1: post-induction I, TP2: post induction II/consolidation I, following TPs: post consolidation/pre-transplantation) (FACSCantoII; BD Facs Diva Software V6.1.3). A positive flow MRD was defined by the presence of no less than 10 clustered leukemic cells/10^4 total events (0.1% threshold).",Efficacy; Multiple Arm; Open Label; Pharmacodynamics; Pharmacokinetics; Safety,"Study Type: Interventional  (Clinical Trial)

ASH 2019:
10 pts treated with Ven (400 mg or 800 mg for 28 days) + Aza and 2 pts treated with Aza alone.
In the dose escalation portion, cohorts were enrolled with escalating doses of Ven administered orally for the first 14 days of each 28-day cycle with cohorts from 100 mg daily up to 400 mg daily. Pts started at 100% of the prescribed Ven dose without intraindividual ramp up. Aza was administered at the std dose (75 mg/m2, subcutaneously or IV) from Day 1-7 per 28-day cycle. 

EHA 2020:
Patients received escalating doses of Ven (100, 200, and 400 mg orally for 14 or 28 days of each 28-day cycle) + Aza (75 mg/m2, subcutaneously or intravenously from day 1?7 per 28-day cycle). 

ASH 2020:
 Ven was initially given at a dose of 400 mg or 800 mg for 28 days in a 28-day cycle. Due to intolerance among patients with MDS, this was later amended to an escalating dose (100, 200, and 400 mg) for 14 days in a 28-day cycle. Aza was administered at 75 mg/m2 subcutaneously or intravenously on Days 1?7 of each 28-day cycle.

ASCO
an initial dose-escalation (~24 pts) and a safety expansion (~20 pts) at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD). Key eligibility criteria are no prior therapy for MDS, an overall International Prognostic Scoring System score of > or = 1.5 (Int-2 and HR), bone marrow blasts > or =5% and < 20%, and ECOG score of =2. VEN will be administered at starting dose level of 100 mg daily for 14 days/cycle (28 days) and may be escalated up to 400 mg for subsequent dose-level cohorts. AZA will be administered at the standard dose (75 mg/m2) for 7 days/cycle. 

ASCO 2021: 
Aza 75 mg/m2 (iv or subQ daily) was administered for 7 days (d) and Ven was administered at 400 mg for 14d in each 28d cycle. In both cohorts, dose modification during Cycle 1 was not recommended; dose modifications in subsequent cycles were prescribed for AEs. In Safety Expansion Cohort 1 (SE1), either Aza or Ven were initially reduced according to investigator?s choice for significant neutrophil or platelet toxicity. Dose reductions per protocol were 33% for Aza and 50% for Ven (for 14d each cycle). In subsequent cycles, Ven duration could be shortened to 9d of each cycle. In Safety Expansion Cohort 2 (SE2), dose modification guidelines recommended stepwise reductions, first in Aza dose (first to 50 mg/m2, then 36 mg/m2) and subsequently in Ven duration to 7d of each cycle (Ven 400 mg). 

ASH 2021:

Participants in the TP-DI sub-study will receive probe-drug cocktail administration at Weeks 43 and 53.
Assigned Interventions: Drug: Probe drug cocktail
The probe drug cocktail consists of 5 mg oral midazolam, 200 mg caffeine,10 mg S-warfarin,10 mg vitamin K, 40 mg omeprazole, 30 mg dextromethorphan

Following a screening period, participants will receive DAC HYP over a 24-week treatment period (6 monthly injections) and then enter a 20-week washout period for monthly assessment of immunogenicity, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety and tolerability. The 20-week washout is necessary to ensure measurement of anti-DAC HYP binding antibodies (ADAbs) and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in the absence of drug interference. After washout, the participants may resume monthly treatment with DAC HYP 150 mg for an additional 3 years. All participants will be followed for 6 months after their last dose for safety monitoring. Additionally, two sub-studies will be performed; an intensive serial PK sampling performed over the first and last dosing interval following DAC HYP doses administered at week 0 and at week 20, and a therapeutic protein-drug interaction (TP-DI) sub-study, during which a probe drug cocktail will be administered at weeks 43 and 53 followed by serial probe-drug PK sampling up to 96 hours after probe-drug administration. A maximum of 20 participants will be enrolled in the TP-DI sub-study.

Patients were treated with mivebresib on a schedule of daily; 3 days/week; or 4 days on, 3 days off.
Two mL of plasma cfDNA (> ore = 10ng) in 5 patients (3 progressive disease [PD], 2 stable disease [SD]) were sequenced with a targeted 63-gene panel (68 Kb) to > or = 800X unique depth after barcode-based error-suppression and genomic alterations discovered in all patients. 

ASCO 2019: 
Mivebresib monotherapy (MIV-mono), or combined with venetoclax (MIV-VEN), were administered daily to adult patients with AML. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) period was 28 d.

Mivebresib was administered daily in 28-day cycles. The dose levels were based on the solid tumor recommended phase 2 dose of 1.5 mg daily18 and available tablet sizes. Patients in the MIV-mono group received 1.5, 2.0, or 2.5 mg of mivebresib. Patients in the MIV-Ven group received 0.5 mg of mivebresib with 400 mg of venetoclax (0.5 mg + 400 mg), 1.0 mg + 400 mg, 1.0 mg + 800 mg, or 2.5 mg + 800 mg. Venetoclax dosing started with a ramp-up phase of 4 days (100 mg on cycle 1 day 1 [C1D1], 200 mg on C1D2, 400 mg on C1D3) to mitigate the risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Mivebresib was added to venetoclax once the target dose was reached and was administered until patients developed progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receiving MIV-mono who experienced progression could re-enroll in combination therapy after a 2-week washout period (switched patients). Antifungal medication was allowed, and venetoclax dose modifications were implemented for moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors (see Supporting Table 2). All patients were hospitalized and monitored the day before starting combination therapy and for the first 48 hours after.",Efficacy; Multiple Arm; Open Label; Pharmacodynamics; Pharmacokinetics; Safety,"Study Type: Interventional  (Clinical Trial)

Experimental: Venetoclax
Venetoclax will be administered orally once daily (QD) beginning with a dose-titration phase. The initial venetoclax dose is 20 mg QD. After 1 week of treatment at 20 mg QD, the dose will be escalated to 50 mg QD followed by subsequent increases, each after 1 week, to 100 mg QD, 200 mg QD and the maximum dose of 400 mg QD. Participants may continue to receive venetoclax for up to 2 years provided they continue to tolerate the drug, have no evidence of disease progression (based on investigator's assessment), do not have unacceptable toxicity, and do not meet any of the criteria for discontinuation.

In countries where venetoclax is not commercially available, participants who continue to derive benefit after 2 years of treatment may be able to extend their treatment for up to 2 additional years, plus one additional year until the venetoclax extension study was open, determined on a case by case basis.

Participants will be randomly put into 1 of 2 treatment groups (standard treatment group or the imaging group). All patients will also undergo the ultrasound assessment. In the standard treatment arm, the doctor will not know the ultrasound result and will base treatment on the routine disease activity score alone. In the imaging group, doctors will use routine clinical disease activity score plus the ultrasound result to make decisions on which treatment is given and treatment will be increased if necessary. However, for patients in the imaging group, even if their rheumatoid arthritis remains stable as judged by the disease activity score, treatment will be increased based on signs of active disease on the ultrasound.

Weekly intra-patient dose-escalation of navitoclax was allowed to a maximum daily dose of 300 mg based on tolerability and platelet count. Tx continued until the end of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation. 

EHA 2020:
Eligible pts received > or =12 wk of continuous Rux Tx and had persistent splenomegaly that required a new Tx. Pts continued their current stable dose of Rux. Nav was initiated at 50 mg QD and escalated to 300 mg QD on the basis of tolerability.

ASH 2020:
Pts continued Rux, and Nav was started at 50 mg QD with stepwise escalation to 300 mg on the basis of tolerability. 

Intervention:
Participants will be administered navitoclax once daily (QD) at various doses and a dose greater than or equal to 10 mg of ruxolitinib twice daily (BID).

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 12 months.

Venetoclax was administered on day 1-14 with a 4-day ramp-up. All patients received standard neutropenic prophylaxis and venetoclax was dose-adjusted for concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors.

Two subjects were started at DL 2 and a Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design was used for subsequent doses, with a true targeted DLT rate of 30%. Re-induction was allowed for persistent disease after the first cycle; subjects with CR were eligible to receive up to three cycles of venetoclax plus cladribine and cytarabine (CLAG) at the same dose level as induction. 

ASH 2024: 
Dose level (DL) 1 was G-CSF 5 mcg/kg days 0-5, cladribine 5 mg/m2 days 1-5, cytarabine 1.5 g/m2 days 1-5, mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 days 1-3, and venetoclax 200 mg days 1-14 with 4-day ramp-up. DL 2 increased venetoclax to 400 mg daily. DL 3 increased mitoxantrone to the standard 16 or 18 mg/m2 days 1-3 for R/R and ND disease respectively.

Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a standard- versus high-induction dose over an 8-week period. At week 8, patients are re-randomized to receive maintenance dosing at 40 mg every week or 40 mg every 2 weeks. The treatment period will last up to 44 weeks.

Patients were randomized 3:2 to receive either the HIR (160 mg at Wks 0, 1, 2, and 3, followed by 40 mg at Wks 4 and 6) or the SIR (160 mg at Wk 0 and 80 mg at Wk 2, followed by 40 mg at Wks 4 and 6) of ADA. At randomization, pts were stratifi ed by baseline corticosteroid use and previous infl iximab (IFX) use. All pts who entered the study on oral corticosteroids were mandated to begin steroid taper at Wk 4. 

Following completion of the induction study at Wk 8, all pts were re-randomized 2:2:1 to ADA 40 mg every week (40 EW), ADA 40 mg every other week (40 EOW), or exploratory ADA 40 mg with therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) regimens, stratified by induction treatment regimen, clinical response status at Wk 8, and clinical remission (CRem) status at Wk 8 among Wk 8 responders. Efficacy endpoints were evaluated in Wk 8 responders (ITT-RP) unless indicated differently. 

All patients in TDM arm received ADA 40mg at Wk8 and Wk10. Patients meeting dose-adjustment criteria(Rectal Bleeding Subscore > or =1 and/or ADA serum concentration < 10 µg/mL) as measured at prior study visit, could escalate to 40EW followed by a single dose of 160mg.

The treatment plan combines a fixed dose of venetoclax and mitoxantrone with increasing doses of cytarabine (V-MAC).
Drug: Venetoclax Oral Tablet
This study will investigate the combination of a fixed maximum venetoclax dose with increasing cytarabine doses plus mitoxantrone in a fixed dose in phase I. In Phase II cytarabine will be given at MDT or RP2D that assessed in phase I.

The venetoclax dose of 400 mg will be reached by a ramp up over 3 days. Parallel chemotherapy with cytarabine and mitoxantrone will start on day 3.

ASH 2022:
In the phase-I dose escalation part, patients with relapsed AML considered fit for intensive salvage treatment were treated in a 3+3 design in three dose cohorts. Venetoclax was given as a ramp-up over 3 days, followed by a fixed dose of 400 mg PO QD over a total period of 14 days, mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 IV fixed dose over three days. The cytarabine dose was 200 mg/m2 continuous infusion over seven days in dose level 1, 500 mg/m2 BID over 3 days in dose level 2, and 1000 mg/m2 BID over 3 days in dose level 3. CYP3A inhibitors were not allowed in phase I, and patients did not receive G-CSF.

Concomitant CYP3A inhibitors were allowed with the appropriate dose adjustments, patients did not receive G-CSF.
Patients achieving a CR could enter a maintenance phase with 400 mg venetoclax PO QD over twelve 28-day cycles.

EHA 2024:
Within the phase-I dose-escalation part, three pts received 200 mg/m2 cytarabine QD over seven days, three received 500 mg/m2 BIDover three days and six received 1000 mg/m2 BID over three days, each with identical doses of venetoclax (400mg PO QD d1-14) and mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2 IV QD d5-7). Pts enrolled in the dose-expansion cohort weretreated with the recommended phase-II dose schedule (400 mg venetoclax PO QD (d1-14) including a 2-dayramp-up, cytarabine 1000 mg/m2 IV BID (d3-5) and mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 IV QD (d5-7)).",Efficacy; Fixed Dose; Multiple Arm; Open Label; Safety,"Study Type  :Interventional  (Clinical Trial)

ASH Abstract:
Patients receive standard DEC (Arm A: 20 mg/m2; intravenous [iv]) daily on days (D) 1-5 or AZA (Arm B: 75 mg/m2; subcutaneous or iv) daily on D1-7 of each 28-D cycle (C), for a minimum of 4 C in combination with once-daily continuous oral VEN on D2-28 in C1, and on D1-28 from C2 and beyond. VEN dose escalation follows a 3+3 design and is currently at the 800-mg dose level. 

ASCO 2016:
Tx-naive pts not eligible for standard induction therapy received DEC (Arm A: 20 mg/m2 iv) daily on days (D) 1-5 or AZA (Arm B: 75 mg/m2; subcutaneous or iv) daily on D 1-7 of each 28-D cycle in combination with once-daily continuous oral VEN. VEN dose escalation follows a 3+3 design; 1200 mg is the final dose level. 

EHA 2017:
Pts received DEC (Arm D, 20 mg/m2/day [d]; intravenous [IV]) on d 1?5, or AZA (Arm E, 75 mg/m2/d; subcutaneous or IV) on d 1?7 of each 28-d cycle (C) in combination with once-daily oral VEN. The dose-expansion stage consisted of 2 VEN dose cohorts (continuous 400-mg and interrupted 800-mg dosing) in each arm (D1, D2, E1, and E2, respectively) to determine optimal dose

ASH 2017:
Patients received oral VEN, which was administered with a short ramp-up during cycle 1 from 20 mg (escalation stage) or 100 mg (expansion stage) to a final dose of 400, 800, or 1200 mg daily. VEN was administered with either DEC 20 mg/m2 given intravenously (IV) on days 1-5 or AZA 75 mg/m2 given IV or subcutaneously on days 1-7 every 28 days (per cycle).

Patients receive doses of Venclexta/Venclyxto at 400mg, 800mg and 1200mg in the escalation phase, and 400mg and 800mg in the expansion phase.

EHA 2018:
Pts received VEN was coadministered daily with 20 mg/m^2 of DEC on days 1-5 or 75 mg/m^2 of AZA on days 1-7, each 28 day cycle. VEN was dosed at 400, 800, or 1200 mg in the escalation phase, and 400 or 800 mg in the expansion phase.

ASH 2018:
The expansion cohort, where patients were treated with 400 mg venetoclax in combination with either HMA. Venetoclax was administered daily in a three day ramp-up from 100 to 200 to 400 mg and coadministered with either 20 mg/m^2 of intravenous (IV) decitabine on days 1-5 or 75 mg/m2 of IV or subcutaneous azacitidine on days 1-7 within each 28 day cycle.

Part 1: Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive co-formulated OBV/PTV/r once daily (25 mg/150 mg/100 mg) co-administered with weight based RBV for 12 (Arm A) or 16 weeks (Arm B) with an approximately equal number of TN and TE subjects in each arm.
All patients received two tablets of coformulated oral ombitasvir (25 mg), paritaprevir (150 mg), and ritonavir (100 mg), taken with food once daily, plus a total daily oral dose of 1000 mg ribavirin if the patient's bodyweight was less than 75 kg, or 1200 mg if bodyweight was 75 kg or more, taken in two doses daily for 24 weeks.
Part 2: A 24 week treatment arm (C) and an exploratory assessment in subjects who have experienced virologic failure with either sofosbuvir/pegIFN/RBV or sofosbuvir/RBV will follow.
All patients received a 24-week treatment with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir plus ribavirin. 

Randomisation was stratified by HCV treatment history (treatment-experienced vs treatment-naive patients) and further stratified by type of non-response to previous HCV treatment (null responders, partial responders, or relapsers) for treatment-experienced patients. Treatments were assigned by an interactive response technology system with computer-generated randomisation lists prepared by personnel from the study's funding sponsor who were not involved with the conduct of the study or with data analysis. 
Safety analyses were done by the treatment duration received (12 weeks or 16 weeks).",Efficacy; Multiple Arm; Open Label; Pharmacokinetics; Randomized; Safety,"Study Type: Interventional
